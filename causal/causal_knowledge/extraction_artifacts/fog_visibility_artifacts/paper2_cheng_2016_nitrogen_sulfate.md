## Key Findings

### 1. Aerosol Liquid Water as Chemistry Reactor
The paper explains the missing source of sulfate during haze events in Beijing through reactive nitrogen chemistry in aerosol water. The aerosol water serves as a reactor where alkaline aerosol components trap SO2, which is oxidized by NO2 to form sulfate.

### 2. Self-Amplifying Mechanism
This mechanism is self-amplifying: higher aerosol mass concentration corresponds to higher aerosol water content, leading to faster sulfate production and more severe haze pollution.

### 3. Key Conditions
- High relative humidity (RH)
- Elevated NO2 concentrations (~66 ppb during haze, 3x higher than clean conditions)
- Neutralized aerosol water (pH 5.4-6.2)
- Weak photochemistry (O3 drops from ~22 ppb to ~1 ppb during haze)

### 4. Sulfate Production Rates
- Clean conditions: 0.01 μg/m³/h
- Most polluted periods: nearly 10 μg/m³/h
- NO2 reaction pathway becomes dominant at PM2.5 ~100-200 μg/m³

### 5. Key Quotes
> "We find that the missing source of sulfate and particulate matter can be explained by reactive nitrogen chemistry in aerosol water."

> "The aerosol water serves as a reactor, where the alkaline aerosol components trap SO2, which is oxidized by NO2 to form sulfate."

> "This mechanism is self-amplifying because higher aerosol mass concentration corresponds to higher aerosol water content, leading to faster sulfate production and more severe haze pollution."

> "During NCP haze days, UV radiation is significantly reduced because of the aerosol dimming effect, resulting in a decrease of most oxidant concentrations."

> "The NO2 pathway may not be limited to winter haze because it may also be important at night and during fog events in polluted regions with high boundary layer concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 and elevated RH."

## Relevance to Edge Cases
This paper explains the "non-intuitive" case where PM2.5 increases rapidly during haze events despite weak photochemistry. It shows that:
1. Traditional models relying on photochemical oxidants underpredict sulfate
2. Aqueous-phase chemistry in aerosol water (not fog/cloud) is the key mechanism
3. High humidity + high NO2 + neutralized aerosols = rapid sulfate formation
