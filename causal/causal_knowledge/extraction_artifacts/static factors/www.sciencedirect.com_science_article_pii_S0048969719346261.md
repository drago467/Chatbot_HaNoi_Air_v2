Abstract
The rapid urban expansion of Hanoi over the last few decades has transformed a lot of agricultural land into urban land uses accompanying pollution by traffic, industrial, and residential emission sources. In this work, the impact of urban expansion on the air pollution landscape has been assessed using the NO2 and SO2 ambient concentrations measured by passive diffusion samplers at 176 sites across the nine urban and the five peri-urban districts of Hanoi spanning an area of 921 km2. The NO2 values ranged from 5.5 to 70 µg m−3 with an arithmetic mean of 34.3 µg m−3. The corresponding figures for SO2 are 1, 51, and 14.5 µg m−3. The pollutant concentrations decrease from the city center outward, reflecting the history of urban expansion with the city fringe being urbanized in the 1980s and the peri-urban area having undergone development from the early 1990s. The pollution landscapes show elevated concentration levels in the recently built-up areas at 6, 10, and 21 km from the city center. The NO2 and SO2 digital maps generated from monitoring data by the kriging technique show numerous traffic and industrial emission hot spots in the peri-urban area. As revealed by the land use regression models, the factors driving the spatial variations of pollutant concentrations across the city include the population density, the road density, and the distances of the monitoring site to the urban center and the nearest roadway.

Introduction
Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam, has experienced rapid urban expansion since the adoption of the reform policy in 1986 to transform Vietnam from a centrally planned system to a market-oriented economy. Under this policy, the government began to introduce liberal market mechanisms that encouraged foreign direct investment (FDI) and private-sector initiatives, as well as relaxing state control of population movements and activities. As a result, new urban areas, industrial zones, and major traffic corridors have been constructed on formerly agricultural land in the city outskirts. The economic activities have expanded mainly toward the north from the Red River (Fig. 1), whereas modern residential areas have been built in the west – southwest.
As a result of the urban expansion, many rural areas in the outskirts have become polluted by traffic and industrial emissions. Meanwhile, air pollution in the cramped inner city has not been relieved by the urban expansion as evidenced by the ongoing increase of permanent residency and registered vehicle ownership in the urban districts (Table 1) (JICA, 2007). In addition, thousands of people are working at national universities, governmental offices, and big business enterprises, which still remain in the urban core. As a result, the main roads leading to the city center are frequently congested by huge flows of commuters traveling to work in the inner city. Significant efforts have been made to relieve traffic congestion, however, their impact on improving the air quality had not been monitored and could not be assessed.
Assessment of the impact of urban expansion on air quality requires a monitoring system that can provide adequate spatial coverage of strongly varied pollutant concentrations across the whole city. The passive sampling method is most suitable for this purpose. Low cost, no power requirements, unattended operation, and the ability to produce accurate results make passive diffusion samplers (PDS) advantageous for long-term measurements of pollutant concentrations at numerous sites across a large territory (Gorecki and Namiesnik, 2002, de Fouquet et al., 2007, Sahsuvaroglu et al., 2012, He et al., 2014). Monitoring data frequently have been combined with topographic, demographic, and land use data in a land use regression (LUR) model with the aim of uncovering factors driving the spatial variations of pollutant concentrations across the study domain (Brigg et al., 2000, Ryan and LeMasters, 2007).
PDS was previously used to measure the ambient concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in summer and winter 2007 at 98 sites across the eight inner districts of Hanoi (Hien et al., 2014). NO2 and SO2 background concentrations up to 70 µg m−3 and 50 µg m−3, respectively, were found in the overcrowded urban core.
In this work, the passive sampling network was extended substantially to 176 background sites, 146 of which were located in the outskirts covering the Long Bien urban district and the five peri-urban districts (Table 1, Fig. 1), which were not studied in the previous work. The results of this work provide the air pollution landscape of Hanoi in 2008 prior to a new urban expansion wave in the wake of the government decision of extending the city boundaries to incorporate many areas of the surrounding provinces (Section 2). From the monitoring data, the mean NO2 and SO2 background concentrations by districts and by buffer zones surrounding the urban core were derived to investigate how air pollution has been advancing from the city center outward during the decades-long urban expansion process. By examining the relationships between the monitoring data and socioeconomic data such as those pertaining to population, transportation, and land use, factors driving the spatial variations of air pollution across the city were inferred to help raise the awareness of society and authorities on the potential environmental impacts of the urban development and expansion.
The kriging technique (Webster and Oliver, 2007) was used to estimate pollutant concentrations and associated interpolation errors at any of the locations in the study area. The digital maps generated by the kriging technique show the locations of elevated NO2 and SO2 emissions in the peri-urban area. Based on the urban characteristics of these locations, the sources of NO2 and SO2 pollution by the rural-to-urban conversion process could be identified. The digital maps of NO2 and SO2 concentrations combined with their interpolation errors serve as a tool for assessing changes at any locations in the future as the urban expansion continues.

Description of the study area
Hanoi lies within the low floodplain of the Red River, about 5–10 m above sea level. The city’s origin officially date back to 1010, when the Vietnam’s capital was established on the southern bank of the Red River, now the Hoan Kiem district (Table 1, Fig. 1). Ba Dinh and northern Hai Ba were created during the northward and southward expansion of Hanoi under the French rule after 1888. By 1954, when Hanoi was liberated from the French colonial regime, it had a population of less than 400,000
Passive sampling network
The NO2 and SO2 ambient concentrations were measured at 44 and 132 background sites in the nine urban and the five peri-urban districts, respectively. To avoid traffic emission hot spots, the air samplers were deployed at least 100 m from major, frequently congested roadways with traffic volumes exceeding 100,000 vehicles per day based on traffic count data of CENMA (2008). The monitoring sites shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 were designed to have a fairly uniform distribution with a density of 0.06
NO2 and SO2 concentrations at monitoring sites
The NO2 values measured at the 176 sampling sites ranged from 5.5 to 70 µg m−3 with an arithmetic mean of 34.3 µg m−3 (Table 3), which is relatively higher than those measured in Mulhouse (21.6 ± 5.9 µg m−3), France (de Fouquet et al., 2007) and Toronto (27.9 µg m−3), Canada (Sahsuvaroglu et al., 2012) but it is lower than the occurrence levels in Huddersfield and Sheffield, UK (42–50 µg m−3) (Brigg et al., 2000), Singapore (48.8 µg m−3) (He et al., 2014), and Beijing (100 µg m−3) (Meng et al., 
Discussion
Anthropogenic sources of NO2 consist of emissions from transportation vehicles, fuel combustion from stationary sources, industrial processes, and household stoves used for cooking (US Environmental Protection Agency, 1993). These sources exist in Hanoi, but traffic is the most important source given the emissions from 5.2 million motorbikes and around 550,000 cars (World Bank, 2011). Coal-fired power plants are located away from the city, but coal and oil combustion at stationary sources may
Conclusion
NO2 and SO2 ambient concentrations were measured at 176 background sites across the nine urban districts and the five peri-urban districts of Hanoi spanning an area of 921 km2. The pollutant concentrations decrease from the urban center outward reflecting the history of urban expansion with the city fringe being completely urbanized in the 1980s and the peri-urban area having undergone development from the late 1990s. The digital maps created by the kriging technique show numerous pollution
