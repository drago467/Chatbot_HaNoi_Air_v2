Statistical analysis

In this study, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to determine potential sources of elements in PM2.5 using SPSS 22.0 software (IBM, USA). The concentration of elements in PM2.5 was normalized by dividing them by the total concentration of each sample. The rotation method was varimax, and eigenvalues higher than one were used for the principal components (PCs) extraction criterion.

Results and discussion
The concentration of PM2.5, SO2, O3, and NO2 obtained from the automatic ambient air quality monitoring station

In this study, we considered ambient air quality data during the partial lockdown (April 1st–April 22nd) and prior to the partial lockdown period (March 10th–March 31st). Air quality data in 2020 represented “current” data. Due to a lack of monitoring data in 2015, 2018, and 2019, air quality measurements in 2017, 2016, and 2014 were considered as the “historical” data. Table 1 presented the concentration of PM2.5, NO2, O3, and SO2 and meteorological data in Hanoi before and during the partial lockdown. As reported in Table 1, most of the meteorological parameters before and during the partial lockdown witnessed small variations. The change of mean temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity from before the partial lockdown in the current year and past years (shown in parentheses) were –3.7% (– 11.8%), 8.7% (–4.2%), and 1.2% (–0.1%), respectively. Therefore, the impact of temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity on the changes of pollution level during the partial lockdown would be minor.

A: Differences of mean concentration during the partial lockdown period in 2020 vs in historical years

B: Differences of mean concentration during the partial lockdown vs before the partial lockdown in 2020

The decrease of air pollutants mainly resulting from the closing of non-essential public places, small industry, and reduced traffic during the Covid-19 lockdown period was also reported in previous studies (Berman and Ebisu 2020; Chauhan and Singh 2020; Nakada and Urban 2020; Otmani et al. 2020). The NO2 concentration dropped from 21.6 μg/m3 to 5.2 μg/m3, showing a significant reduction (–75.8%) during the current partial lockdown period compared with historical data. There was also a significant NO2 decline (–55.1%) with an absolute reduction of –6.4 μg/m3 before and during the partial lockdown in 2020. A decrease of NO2 concentrations was consistent with the value of –52.7% in Delhi, India (Mahato et al. 2020), and higher than the value of –46.6% in São Paulo, Brazil (Nakada and Urban 2020). The sharp variation of NO2 concentration is possibly associated with the abrupt decrease in vehicular traffic during the partial lockdown resulting from “work-from-home” and international and national travel limitations. Hien et al. (2014) demonstrated that exhaust emissions of motorbikes are a major source of NO2 in Hanoi. Additionally, SO2 declined 60.7% during the partial lockdown compared with the same dates in historical years. The SO2 reduction in this study is higher than other researchers found in the Yangtze River Delta Region (15–26%) (Li et al. 2020) and Malaysia (9– 20%) (Kanniah et al. 2020). However, a slight increase of SO2 (13.5%) was observed during the partial lockdown compared with the pre-partial-lockdown period in 2020. The small increase of SO2 concentration during the lockdown in Almaty, Kazakhstan, was reported by Kerimray et al. (2020), which could be statistically insignificant. The reduction of vehicular traffic and the closure of non-essential shops and businesses during the partial lockdown could cause a decrease of [NO2]/[SO2]. Both mobile sources (motorcycles (with two-stroke petrol engines), diesel trucks, buses, cars, and boats) and stationary sources (industry, power generation, and burning of biomass) are responsible for air pollution in big cities in Vietnam. Biomass burning sources include cooking and heating activities in homes and the street, burning of rubbish, and burning of rice straw and fresh vegetation in surrounding rural areas. Additionally, construction activities are both mobile and stationary sources that have made significant contributions to air pollution in Hanoi. Figure 2 illustrates a significant decrease of [NO2]/[SO2] during the partial lockdown period compared with that of historical years and before the lockdown period in 2020. The mean values of [NO2]/[SO2] before the partial lockdown were two times higher than that of the partial lockdown period. There was a significant drop in traffic during the partial lockdown, which caused the reduction of mobile emission sources. Although the industrial sector was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, the industry factories and power plants in Vietnam still operate during the partial lockdown, which may lead to an insignificant change in the contribution of stationary sources. Thus, a drastic reduction of [NO2]/[SO2] during the partial lockdown was observed in Hanoi due to a significant reduction of mobile sources (vehicular traffic). Lian et al. (2020) also reported a significant reduction of [NO2]/[SO2] during the Covid-19 lockdown period in Wuhan, China. The partial lockdown in Hanoi experienced a reduction of –55.9% in PM2.5 concentration with the absolute decline of –55.0 μg/m3 compared with the same period in the past years. The reduced concentration of PM2.5 during the quarantine compared with historical years was higher than findings of other recent publications. PM2.5 reduction rate during the partial lockdown compared with historical years was 27.12% in megacity Delhi, India (Mahato et al. 2020), 39.0% in Gujarat state of India (Selvam et al. 2020), 29.8% in São Paulo state (Nakada and Urban 2020), and 32% in NewYork, USA (Chauhan and Singh 2020). A lower reduction of PM2.5 (–18.0%) during the partial lockdown compared with the pre-partial-lockdown in 2020 was recorded, which was less than a reduction of 23–32% in PM2.5 concentration in Malaysia (Kanniah et al. 2020). The decline of PM2.5 was less than the reduction of NO2, which may be because PM2.5 was emitted from multiple non-transportation sources such as industrial factories and biomass burning (Berman and Ebisu 2020).

Mass concentration ratio of [NO2]/[SO2] before and during the partial lockdown in 2020 and in historical years

The average concentration of O3 decreased by –21.4% from 21.6 μg/m3 (average of historical years) to 17.1 μg/m3 (2020). However, an increase of 40.7% in O3 from 12.2 μg/m3 (before the partial lockdown) to 17.1 μg/m3 (during the partial lockdown) occurred in 2020. This result could be attributed to a high association between solar activity levels and the concentration of O3 (Nakada and Urban 2020). An increase of 20% in surface solar radiation during the partial lockdown period compared with the same days in historical years would lead to an increase in O3 concentration. On the other hand, a decline of O3 concentration in 2020 compared with historical data could be explained that surface solar radiation during the partial quarantine was 20% higher than the value measured before the partial lockdown period in 2020. The amplified O3 pollution was observed in cities worldwide. Sicard et al. (2020) reported the daily O3 mean concentrations increased at urban stations by 24% in Nice, 14% in Rome, 27% in Turin, 2.4% in Valencia, and 36% in Wuhan during the lockdown in 2020. Besides the high solar radiation activities, the increase of O3 can be attributed to the effect of chemical reactions caused by the strong decrease of nitrogen oxide emissions and PM2.5 (Chen et al. 2020; Menut et al. 2020; Sicard et al. 2020).

PM2.5 concentrations obtained from fieldwork

The PM2.5 concentration and average elemental concentration in PM2.5 at three sites in Hanoi prior to and during the partial lockdown period were shown in Table 2. The average PM2.5 concentration ranged from 73.65 to 90.67 μg/m3 before the partial lockdown period, which was higher than the ambient air quality standard in Vietnam for 24-h (50 μg/m3) and the annual standard (25 μg/m3) (QCVN 05:2013/BTNMT). Besides, the mean PM2.5 mass observed in this study was about 1.9 to 3.6 times higher than the guideline value suggested by WHO 24-h (25 μg/m3). Our study showed that the average PM2.5 concentration during the partial lockdown (47.85 μg/m3) was lower than the ambient air quality standards in Vietnam for 24-h, a decreased of –41.8 % compared with that before the partial lockdown. The average PM2.5 during the partial lockdown in this study was much higher than that in New York, USA (9.48 μg/m3), in Zaragoza, Spain (29.38 μg/m3) (Chauhan and Singh 2020), and in Sao Paulo, Brazil (12.4–12.5 μg/m3) (Nakada and Urban 2020). However, this study reported lower daily mean PM2.5 than in Megacity Delhi, India (60 μg/m3) (Mahato et al. 2020). A reduction of –41.8 % in PM2.5 in our study was much higher than that in Delhi, India (– 53.11%) (Mahato et al. 2020), in São Paulo state, Brazil (– 29.8%) (Nakada and Urban 2020), in Malaysia (23–32%) (Kanniah et al. 2020) and was similar to findings reported by Zoran et al. (2020).

Relationship between PM2.5 pollution and the boundary layer height (BLH)

Several studies have shown that the high boundary layer height (BLH) being associated with the low pollution level of particulate matter and vice versa (Chen and Xie 2014; Chu et al. 2019). Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between the BLH and PM2.5 concentrations obtained from both fieldwork and the automatic ambient air quality monitoring station in Hanoi. The hourly BLH data was first obtained from the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis. After that, it was aggregated to the daily mean values and the mean values according to the sampling time to analyze its correlation with PM2.5 data from the automatic ambient air quality monitoring station and sampling sites, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, the significantly negative correlation between the BLH and the PM2.5 obtained from the automatic air monitoring station (R = –0.37) and the PM2.5 obtained from fieldwork (R = –0.47) indicated that the shallow BLH would exacerbate the PM2.5 pollution. The significant negative correlation between the BLH and the daily PM2.5 concentration was also reported in Miao et al. (2017) with the range of R-value from –0.32 to –0.37. The negative correlation between the BLH and the PM2.5 concentrations could be explained by the fact that the vertical volume for dispersion and dilution of pollutants was regulated by the BLH, which modulates the PM2.5 concentration (Miao et al. 2019). In addition, the reduction of the PM2.5 pollution level would lead to an increase in the BLH due to the increment of surface solar radiation (Wang et al. 2020b). Therefore, to some extent, the increment of the BLH and surface solar radiation as shown in Table 1 would be partially attributed to the reduction of PM2.5 in Hanoi.

Concentration of elements bound to PM2.5

Twenty elements in PM2.5 (Al, Na, Mg, V, K, Ba, Mn, Co, Ca, Fe, Cr, Cu, Ni, Mo, As, Pb, Zn, Cd, Ti, and Sr) were measured in this study. As shown in Table 2, the concentration of the most abundant elements (Fe, Al, Ca, K, Na, Mg, and Zn) was significantly higher than those of others at all sites before and during the partial lockdown. These elements were representative of crustal elements. The concentrations of Cd, As, Ba, Cu, Mn, Pb, K, Zn, Ca, Al, Mg, and Sr before the partial lockdown were higher than those during the partial lockdown, while the concentrations of V prior to and during the partial lockdown were similar. Our results showed that concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, and K were substantially decreased by 42.5, 45.2, 52.6, 51.7, and 44.7%, respectively, during the partial lockdown. Cu, Pb, Zn, are Fe are emitted from non-exhaust traffic sources such as tire and brake wear (Alves et al. 2018). Moreover, Jeong et al. (2019) showed that non-exhaust emissions contained a high contribution of trace elements (74% of Ba, 56% of Cu, and 42% of Fe). Denier van der Gon et al. (2007) showed that brake wear emissions accounted for up to 75% of Cu emissions into the air. Therefore, the decreases in the concentration of these metals could be the result of restriction on the traffic activities during the partial lockdown.
