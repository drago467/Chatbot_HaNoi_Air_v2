## Key Findings for Static Factors

### Vegetation Dry Deposition Mechanism
**Quote 1**: "Forests are more efficient than wetlands and lakes in PM pollution removal."
- Source: Highlights

**Quote 2**: "The deposition velocity onto the forest canopy was higher than which onto the wetland and the water surface and the velocity varied in different seasons"
- Source: Abstract

**Quote 3**: "Fine particles deposited most in winter while the coarse particles were in spring."
- Source: Highlights

**Quote 4**: "The PM removal due to vegetation was lower than 1%."
- Source: Highlights

### Mechanism Explanation
From Introduction:
- "Forests are effective for absorbing and filtering PM"
- "The forest canopy can increase PM dry deposition by leading air movement"
- "A study in England showed that the concentration of inhalable particles in the West Midlands was reduced by 10% and that 10 t PM10 settled every year as the urban forest coverage increased from 3.7% to 16.5%"
- "Fifty percent of PMs produced by the open cast mining process could be reduced by a 15 km wide birch forest"
- "In Mexico, the forests in media areas can remove 100 t PM10 from the air every year, amounting to 2% of annual emissions"

### Factors Affecting Deposition
- Canopy density and plant species
- Relatively sparse forests more efficient in PM deposition
- Meteorological factors: wind speed, humidity, temperature
- Shorter tree-building distance and canopy-canopy distance can reduce PM concentrations more efficiently

### Conclusions from Paper
1. Forests, wetlands and lakes can deposit PMs efficiently while forest has best ability to remove fine particle pollution
2. Maximum fine particle deposition occurred in winter
3. Dry deposition influenced by both atmospheric condition and PM concentrations

## Relevant for Relationships
1. **lulc_vegetation → pm25** (INDIRECT_CAUSE - decrease via dry deposition)
   - Mechanism: Vegetation removes PM2.5 through dry deposition process - particles deposit on leaf surfaces through interception, impaction, and sedimentation
   - Forest canopy increases deposition by leading air movement
   - Deposition velocity higher on forest canopy than wetland/water surface
   - Strength: MODERATE
   - Confidence: HIGH
   - Seasonal: all_season (but maximum fine particle deposition in winter)
   - Note: PM removal due to vegetation was lower than 1% in this study - effect is modest but measurable
