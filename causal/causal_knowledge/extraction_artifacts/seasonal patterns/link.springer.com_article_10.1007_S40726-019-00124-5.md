The two-way feedback mechanism between unfavorable meteorological conditions and cumulative aerosol pollution in various haze regions of China. Atmos Chem Phys. 2019;19:3287–306 This paper analyzes the two-way feedback mechanisims between unfavorable meteorological conditions and the cumulative PM 2.5pollution in China using PM 2.5observation, surface radiation data, sounding measurments, and ERA-Interim reanalysis. The studied regions include Guanzhong Plain, Yangtze River Delta, Two Lakes Basin, Pearl River Delta, Sichuan Basin, and Northeast China.
