## Key Findings

### 1. Solar Radiation Drives Rapid SOA Production
At lower pollution levels, the intense solar radiation caused substantial and rapid production of OOA (O/C = 0.81) and intermediate VOCs (both in a high oxidation state) at a rate of 15.0% h⁻¹ and 14.0% h⁻¹, respectively.

### 2. Contrasting Mechanisms: Solar Radiation vs RH
Meteorological conditions of relative humidity (RH) and solar radiation drive contrasting reaction mechanisms:
- Higher direct solar radiation typically induces lower RH
- RH is typically high at night
- Both factors are predominantly anticorrelated in ambient environments

### 3. High Pollution vs Low Pollution Conditions
- **High pollution levels** (weaker solar radiation, higher RH): Moderately oxygenated OA (O/C = 0.61) and secondary inorganics were coproduced with rapid consumption of all VOCs
- **Lower pollution levels** (intense solar radiation): Substantial and rapid production of highly oxygenated OOA (O/C = 0.81)

## Relevance to Edge Cases
This paper is highly relevant to the edge case of "clear sky high PM2.5":
1. Provides quantitative evidence for rapid SOA production under intense solar radiation
2. Explains the mechanism of photochemical oxidation driving secondary aerosol formation
3. Shows that clear sky conditions (high radiation, low RH) can still produce significant secondary aerosols
