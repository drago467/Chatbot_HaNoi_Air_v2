## Key Findings

### SOA Formation Pathways
The study reveals three main pathways for SOA formation:

1. **Photochemical pathway (Ox-initiated SOA)**:
   - Most important under high-Ox conditions (O3 + NO2 = 65.1 ± 20.4 ppb)
   - Dominated daytime SOA formation (65% of OA)
   - Average growth rate: **0.8 µg/m³/h**

2. **Nocturnal aqueous-phase SOA (aqSOA)**:
   - Significant during high-RH periods (83.7 ± 12.5%)
   - Contributed 45% to OA
   - Nighttime growth rate: **0.6 µg/m³/h**

3. **Daytime aqueous-phase photochemistry**:
   - Growth rate: **0.6 µg/m³/h**
   - Contributed 39% to OA
   - Non-negligible pathway in summer

### Conditions
- High-Ox conditions favor photochemical SOA
- High-RH conditions favor aqueous-phase SOA
- Summer conditions with high oxidation capacity

### Quantitative Data
- Ox-initiated SOA: 0.8 µg/m³/h growth rate (daytime)
- aqSOA: 0.6 µg/m³/h growth rate (nighttime)
- Daytime aqueous photochemistry: 0.6 µg/m³/h

## Relevant Quotes
> "The photochemical pathway is the most important under high-Ox (i.e., O3 + NO2) conditions (65.1 ± 20.4 ppb). The efficient SOA formation from photochemistry (Ox-initiated SOA) dominated the daytime (65 % to OA), with an average growth rate of 0.8 µg/m³/h."

> "During the high-relative-humidity (RH; 83.7 ± 12.5 %) period, strong nocturnal aqueous-phase SOA formation (aqSOA) played a significant role in SOA production (45 % to OA), with a nighttime growth rate of 0.6 µg/m³/h."

## Applicability to Hanoi/Vietnam
- North China Plain has similar pollution characteristics
- Summer monsoon conditions comparable
- High humidity periods relevant to tropical/subtropical climate
