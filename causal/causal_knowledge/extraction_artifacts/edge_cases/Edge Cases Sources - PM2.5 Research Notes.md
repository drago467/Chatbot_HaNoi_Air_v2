## Source 3 (Updated): PM2.5 in Hanoi and Cold Surge
**Title:** Characterizing PM2.5 in Hanoi with New High Temporal Resolution Sensor
**Authors:** Bich-Thuy Ly, Yutaka Matsumi, Tomoki Nakayama, Yosuke Sakamoto, Yoshizumi Kajii, Trung-Dung Nghiem
**Year:** 2018
**Journal:** Aerosol and Air Quality Research, 18: 2487-2497
**DOI:** 10.4209/aaqr.2017.10.0435
**URL:** https://aaqr.org/articles/aaqr-17-10-maps-0435.pdf

### Key Findings from PDF:
- **Hanoi PM2.5 levels**: High in winter (Dec-Jan: median 62-59 μg/m³), low in summer (June-July: median 19 μg/m³)
- **Cold surge definition**: Daily temperature drop of 2°C or more within 2 days AND hourly temperature drop of at least 2°C
- **Cold surge as indicator**: "Timings of cold surges, which were proposed as an indicator for haze episodes in previous research (Hien et al., 2011), are presented"
- **Seasonal variation**: PM2.5 in December and January were about three times higher than in July
- **Main sources**: Secondary mixed PM (40%), diesel traffic (10%), residential/commercial cooking (16%), secondary sulfate rich (16%), aged seasalt mixed (11%)

### Quote (from visible text):
"Timings of cold surges, which were proposed as an indicator for haze episodes in previous research (Hien et al., 2011), are presented. Whereas Hien et al. (2011) used daily temperature drop of 2°C or more within 2 days and an hourly temperature drop of at least 2°C as criteria for a cold surge, we used a 2°C or more daily temperature drop as a criterion."



### Additional Key Findings (Page 7):
- **Two PM2.5 episodes**: 24-hour averages of 150-200 μg/m³ were observed
- **11 episodes with PM2.5 levels of 100-150 μg/m³** were detected
- **Large increases in both PM2.5 and CO were frequently observed several days after cold surges**
- **These phenomena were observed 14 times during the dry season**
- **Cold surge mechanism**: "A cold surge, which is caused by an air parcel being moved from the north and northeast due to the outflow from a high-pressure system in Siberia or the Pacific, is often followed by stagnant conditions. The stagnant conditions then caused a temperature inversion, trapping pollutants near the surface"
- **Delayed effect**: "During five days after the cold surges, peaks of PM2.5 were appeared at night. High hourly levels of PM2.5 (higher than 120 μg/m³) appeared at the fourth day after the cold surge and a level higher than 160 μg/m³ were observed at the fifth day after the cold surge"

### Quote (Critical for Edge Case):
"Large increases in both PM2.5 and CO were frequently observed several days after cold surges. These phenomena were observed 14 times during the dry season. The observed frequency of the high PM episodes after cold surges was similar to that quoted in previous research on PM10 (Hien et al., 2011)."

"During five days after the cold surges, peaks of PM2.5 were appeared at night. High hourly levels of PM2.5 (higher than 120 μg m⁻³) appeared at the fourth day after the cold surge and a level higher than 160 μg m⁻³ were observed at the fifth day after the cold surge."

## Source 8: Rapid Reappearance of Air Pollution After Cold Air Outbreaks
**Title:** Rapid reappearance of air pollution after cold air outbreaks in northern and eastern China
**Authors:** Qian Liu, Guixing Chen, Lifang Sheng, and Toshiki Iwasaki
**Year:** 2022
**Journal:** Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, 22, 13371-13388
**DOI:** 10.5194/acp-22-13371-2022
**URL:** https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/22/13371/2022/

### Key Findings:
- **Rapid reappearance of air pollution in CAO decay phase has occurrence frequency of 63%**
- **Air quality in more than 50% of CAOs worsens compared to before CAO**
- **Reappearance of air pollution tends to occur in residual cold air mass with weak horizontal flux during first 2 days after CAO**
- **Residual cold air mass with moderate depth of 150-180 hPa, large negative heat content, and small slopes of isentropes is favorable for rapid reappearance**
- **Cold air mass depth is highly consistent with mixing layer height**
- **Rapid reappearance attributed to maintenance of residual cold air mass regulated by dynamic transport process**

### Quote (Critical for Edge Case):
"The cold air outbreak (CAO) is the most important way to reduce air pollution during the winter over northern and eastern China. However, a rapid reappearance of air pollution is usually observed during its decay phase... Based on the analyses of recent winters (2014–2022), we found that the rapid reappearance of air pollution in the CAO decay phase has an occurrence frequency of 63%, and the air quality in more than 50% of CAOs worsens compared to that before CAO."

"During the reappearance of air pollution, the regional mean pollutant concentrations increased by as much as 2.8 times compared to concentrations reduced by CAO."

### Mechanism:
"The rapid reappearance of air pollution is mainly attributed to the stable stratification in the lower troposphere forced by the intrusion of a cold air mass. A comparison of the two groups of CAOs shows that the depth, NHC, and the vertical structure of the cold air mass are key features modulating the reappearance of air pollution."

## Source 9: Hygroscopic Properties of PM and Measurement Effects
**Title:** Hygroscopic properties of particulate matter and effects of their interactions with weather on visibility
**Authors:** Wan-Sik Won, Rosy Oh, Woojoo Lee, Sungkwan Ku, Pei-Chen Su, Yong-Jin Yoon
**Year:** 2021
**Journal:** Scientific Reports, 11:16401
**DOI:** 10.1038/s41598-021-95834-6
**URL:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8361198/

### Key Findings:
- **Hygroscopic property of PM influencing light scattering and absorption is vital for determining visibility and accurate sensing of PM**
- **PM2.5 exhibits better hygroscopic properties for light scattering than CPM**
- **Hygroscopic growth is the change of diameter of a particle due to uptake of water**
- **Hygroscopic growth factor = D(RH)/D(dry) - ratio of diameter at given RH to dry particle**
- **Low-cost sensors overestimate PM concentration affected by humidity** (measurement artifact)
- **RH shows highest correlation with visibility (-0.59), followed by PM2.5 (-0.50)**
- **Positive correlation between RH and PM2.5 (0.20)**

### Quote (Critical for Measurement Artifact):
"An important reason for the lower accuracies is that low-cost sensors lack the RH and temperature control functions; therefore, light scattering sensors overestimate the PM concentration affected by humidity."

"Owing to its abundant water-soluble particles, PM2.5 exhibits better hygroscopic properties for light scattering, thereby affecting visibility more than the CPM."

### Mechanism:
"Water vapor impacts visibility because of the hygroscopic growth at elevated relative humidity (RH). The hygroscopic growth is the change of the diameter of a particle because of the uptake of water."

"Hygroscopic PM scatters more light under humid weather conditions, resulting in lower visibility at high RH levels."

## Source 10: Vertical Wind Shear and Regional Transport Effect on PM2.5
**Title:** Effect of Vertical Wind Shear on PM2.5 Changes over a Receptor Region in Central China
**Authors:** Xiaoyun Sun, Yue Zhou, Tianliang Zhao, Yongqing Bai, Tao Huo, Liang Leng, Huan He, Jing Sun
**Year:** 2022
**Journal:** Remote Sensing, 14(14), 3333
**DOI:** 10.3390/rs14143333
**URL:** https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/14/3333

### Key Findings:
- **Correlation between wind speed and PM2.5 was NEGATIVE for clean conditions and POSITIVE for polluted conditions**
- **Regional transport of air pollutants is a remarkable contributor to regional air pollution events**
- **Strong northerly wind accompanied by enhanced VWS above 2 km favored long-range transport of air pollutants**
- **Prevailed northerly wind disrupted local circulation and enhanced surface PM2.5 concentrations under polluted conditions**
- **Transport height of above 2 km in receptor region**
- **PM2.5 pollution in Twain-Hu Basin was affected by long-distance transport**

### Quote (Critical for Edge Case - Wind Transport Exception):
"The correlation between wind speed and PM2.5 was negative for clean conditions and positive for polluted conditions in both two sites."

"In downstream CS, the weak wind and VWS in the height of 1–2 km stabilized the ABL under polluted conditions, and strong northerly wind accompanied by enhanced VWS above 2 km favored the long-range transport of air pollutants."

"Prevailed northerly wind disrupted the local circulation and enhanced the surface PM2.5 concentrations under polluted conditions, which tend to be an indicator of regional transport of air pollutants."

### Mechanism:
"The increased VWS with strong wind enhanced vertical mixing, which blocked the air pollutants in the local region and might bring in the transported air pollutants from upstream regions in the upper layers."
