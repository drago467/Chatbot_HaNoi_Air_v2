) is much closer to the results of O1 (
 s−1 for particle size in the range of 0.014–10.35 µm). Since O1 is based on the variations in the aerosol numbers below the cloud, it may be more suitable for the estimation of the BWSCs. It also indicates that the updated O2′ is much more reasonable than the original O2 for estimation of BWSCs of various chemical species. In contrast, the BWSC of T (
 s−1) is an order of magnitude lower than the observational results. Considering the effects of thermophoresis, diffusiophoresis and electric charges, there is a wider range of 3 orders of magnitude (10−6–10−4 s−1) (X. H. Wang et al., 2010; Y. Wang et al., 2014). In addition, the BWSC for M (
 s−1) is also 1 order of magnitude lower than the field measurements. The low BWSC in CTMs could explain the underestimation of simulated wet deposition, which is mainly thought to be caused by chemical process, modeled precipitation and emissions in previous studies (Wang et al., 2008; Ge et al., 2011). Thus, the observed O1 and O2′ may revise the T and M results in the future.

To further compare the BWSCs based on the particle size, the results in this study are compared with those of previous studies in Fig. 4. The size-resolved BWSCs of 0.014–0.74, 0.2–2.5 and 0.7–10.35 µm are the total number concentration from SMPS, SPAMS and POPC, respectively, which are within a certain range (
–
 s−1). At approximately 0.2 µm (the lower limit detection of the multicomponent analysis), the O1 of 0.014–0.74 and 0.2–2.5 µm results have a gap that mainly originates from the use of different experimental instruments and their detection limits. However, the estimated results for larger sizes (dp>3 µm) by POPC have great fluctuation, mainly due to lower number concentrations (<2 cm−3), and were considered unreliable in this work. The BWSC from O1 showed a slowly decreasing trend in 0.014–0.2 µm and a significant increasing trend as dp>0.2 µm in this study, which is similar to the results from Huang Mountain (Y. Wang et al., 2014) and southern Finland (Laakso et al., 2003). Besides, the BWSC from O2′ for SNA are similar to the results of O1 in 2.5 µm. Although there is a different trend to that reported in Lanzhou (Zhao et al., 2015) before 0.6 µm, both studies exhibited an increasing trend after 0.6 µm. The difference of BWSCs from O1 in each sites may be due to the measuring conditions (Wang et al., 2010). However, compared to the T, this difference is very small, as shown in Fig. 4. Different from the observational results, the theoretical results show a strong dependence on the particle size with obvious decreasing trend (dp<1 µm) and quickly increasing trend (dp>1 µm). As Seinfeld and Pandis (2016) mentioned, Brownian diffusion and inertial impaction are the principal mechanisms affecting collection efficiency with dp smaller than 0.2 µm and larger than 2.5 µm, respectively. Theoretical estimation can effectively characterize the observed BWSC of aerosols in these two ranges. For the Greenfield gap, there is large difference between the BWSC from O1 and T, with the latter being 1 order of magnitude lower. One reason is that all the influencing mechanisms have still not been fully considered and understood (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2016), another reason is the existing ideal assumptions in derivation, such as there being no chemical reactions or emissions in the scavenging process. The ignored irregular surface of the aerosols and hygroscopic growth will increase the concentration of particles and then influence the scavenging efficiency (Y. Wang et al., 2014). Another extensive explanation is that the turbulent flow fluctuation, evaporation and breakup of raindrops are also important but neglected processes (Wang et al., 2010).

3.3 The parameterization of BWSCs

To discuss the uncertainties of the BWSC underestimation by theoretical calculations in different rainfall events, nine rain events at the same sampling site in summer of 2014 (by O2′) have also been included. As shown in Fig. 5, a strong relationship between the BWSCs and precipitation intensity obeys exponential power distribution both in the summer of 2014 and the rainfall event in winter of the APHH-Beijing campaign in Beijing with coefficients of determination for SNA over 0.68. Since the estimated BWSCs for SNA based on O1 and O2′ in this event are in line with previous studies in summer, it indicated that the wet scavenging rule and regression fitting formulae are also universal in Beijing not only in summer but also in winter. In fact, this exponential power relationship has been confirmed in previous studies (Jylhä, 1991; Okita et al., 1996; Andronache, 2004a; X. H. Wang et al., 2014a, b; Xu et al., 2017):

where parameter b represents the change rate of BWSCs along with P, while a is equal to the WSCs when the P=1 mm h−1. Both a and b relate to chemical species and aerosol particle size.

For further comparison, Fig. 6 displays the parameterization of a and b in the exponential power relationship for BWSCs with the precipitation intensity by multi-method determination, i.e., using theoretical methods and field measurement methods. For the theory calculation, the parameter a varies from a relatively wide range of 
–
 s−1 and BWSCs also have a wide range of 3–4 orders of magnitude for given precipitation intensities (Andronache, 2003; X. H. Wang et al., 2014a). Similar to the multi-method comparison of estimated BWSCs in this rainfall event of the APHH-Beijing campaign, parameterization for BWSCs obtained by O2 and O2′ show a higher magnitude of variations with the precipitation intensity, where all of the straight lines lie above the upper range of T. This indicates that recent theory-calculated BWSCs have an obvious underestimation not only during a rainfall event but also in the parameterization of large number of rainfall events with different precipitation intensities and need revision or updating via field measurement estimation.

3.4 Impacts and implications

To investigate the impacts of the wet scavenging on aerosol concentrations in the air and the wet depositions in rainfall, multi-method-estimated BWSCs included in Table 2 were used to rebuild the aerosol concentrations and wet depositions after the 1 h rainfall event. Assuming the aerosol concentrations in the air are only influenced by wet scavenging during the rainfall event, its variation should be followed by Eq. (13) according to Seinfeld and Pandis (2016):

Variations in aerosol concentration can be resolved as in Eq. (14), in which the K is a constant BWSC. Here, K and t are the BWSCs and the scavenging time and Ca0 is the original aerosol concentration before the rainfall. In this study, the Ca0 has been observed as being 17.6, 9.8, 9.7 and 74.7 µg m−3 for 
, 
, 
 and PM2.5, respectively. After 1 h of wet scavenging by rainfall, the concentration of 
, 
, 
 and PM2.5 decreased to 14.3, 7.6, 7.9 and 65.2 µg m−3, respectively. Previous studies have confirmed that the exponential power distribution between the WSCs and precipitation intensity as Eq. (12). The size-resolved BWSC are accumulated for calculating the total BWSC for PM2.5. As it is shown in Table 2, the calculated aerosol concentrations using T and M BWSCs performed the obvious overestimation of PM2.5 concentrations with the bias from 2.3 to 9 µg m−3, while showing similar results to the observation for O1 and O2′ BWSCs (bias<1 µg m−3). It should be noted that the magnitude of BWSCs in the range of 10−5–10−4 perform calculated aerosol concentrations better than those in the lower range. Wet deposition has also been reconstructed according to Eq. (7), with the precipitation intensity set to 0.17 mm h−1 and column height set to 3 km. The normalized mean bias (NMB) for the below-cloud wet depositions of 
 and 
 are −28 % and −33 %, while for 
 it is −49 % according to the BWSCs in this study shown in Table 2.

Overall, the O1 and updated O2′ field observation results can effectively characterize the below-cloud scavenging ability, whereas T and M have obvious deviation. Therefore, the field measurements are needed to compensate for the defects in the theoretical and modeling calculations, which provides room to make further progress in wet deposition numerical simulations.

4 Conclusions

An evaluation of below-cloud wet scavenging ability is first conducted based on field measurements and accompanied by the theoretical estimation and modeling calculation. The averaged BWSCs obtained by field measurements are similar to each other (10−5 s−1) and there is a strong exponential power relationship between BWSCs and precipitation intensity. Theoretical estimations coincide well with the observed BWSCs of aerosols with dp in ranges smaller than 0.2 µm and larger than 2.5 µm but are an order of magnitude lower than the observed BWSCs within 0.2–2.5 µm. In the form of exponential power distribution between BWSCs and precipitation intensity, the upper range of theoretical results is also lower than the measurement estimation. Thus, the underestimation of BWSC through theoretical methods has been confirmed not only in APHH-Beijing campaign but also in all rainfall events in summer of 2014. These theoretical values are usually applied in CTMs with a simplified scheme; accordingly, the model calculations show lower BWSCs. This may explain the underprediction of wet deposition in both global and regional models of polluted regions. Field measurements are currently required to compensate for the theoretical and modeling calculations and to construct a more reasonable and suitable simulation scheme to improve the wet deposition simulation, especially in polluted regions.
