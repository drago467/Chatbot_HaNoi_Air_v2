Abstract
Twenty-four hour samples of air particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters from 2 to 10 μm (PM10) and <2.5 μm (PM2.5) were collected in Hanoi throughout 1 year since August 1998. The air sampler was located in a meteorological garden where routine surface observations and upper air radiosoundings were conducted. Very high PM2.5 and PM2.5−10 concentrations were observed in conjunction with the occurrence of nocturnal radiation inversions from October to December and subsidence temperature inversions (STI) from January to March. In the first case, the PM2.5−10 fraction was much enhanced and particulate pollution was significantly higher at night than in daytime. During the occurence of STIs particulate mass was almost evenly distributed among the two fractions and no significant diurnal variations in concentrations were observed. In summer (May–September) particulate pollution was much lower than in winter.
The multiple regression of 24-h particulate concentrations against meteorological parameters for both the winter and summer monsoon periods shows that the most important determinants of PM2.5 are wind speed and air temperature, while rainfall and relative humidity largely control the daily variations of PM2.5−10, indicating the high abundance of soil dust in this fraction. As to turbulence parameters, among the determinants of 24-h particulate concentrations are the vertical gradients of potential temperature and wind speed recorded at 06.30 and 18.30, respectively. Meteorological parameters could explain from 60% to 74% of the day-to-day variations of particulate concentrations.
Introduction
The rapid economic development since the introduction of a market orientation reform in the late 1980s has dramatically changed the face of the 3.5 million Vietnam's capital, Hanoi. In the meantime, uncontrolled growth of construction works, traffic and small manufacturing activities has resulted in an increasing number of air pollution sources. Dusty atmosphere is visible, especially during the dry winter season.
A systematic air particulate pollution study has begun in Hanoi since 1998. The 24-h PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters <10 μm) concentration varies substantially, from as low as 10 μg m−3 in the rainy monsoon months (June–August) to over 300 μg m−3 in the winter (October–March). The development of appropriate pollution abatement measures requires a thorough understanding of the nature of major emission sources and atmospheric conditions governing the variations of air particulate concentrations, particularly those relevant to pollution episodes.
The variations of atmospheric conditions in Hanoi are governed by large-scale air circulations which are driving the monsoon regime in East and Southeast Asia. Relatively few investigations have been conducted on the relationships between air pollution and the monsoon regime in this region. These include the works of Chung et al. (1999), Cheng and Lam (2000) and Wang et al. (2001) on the responses of pollutant gases to synoptic conditions in Hong Kong; Hien et al. (1999) on the seasonal variations of the impact of major emission sources on a receptor site in Ho Chi Minh City; and Pochanart et al. (2001) on the long-range transport of O3 under Asian monsoon regime.
To investigate the impact of monsoon conditions on air pollution in Hanoi, a year-round monitoring study was carried out for air particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters <2.5 μm (PM2.5) and from 2.5 to 10 μm (PM2.5−10). Based on daily synoptic weather maps and meteorological data provided by surface observations and upper air radiosoundings, atmospheric conditions and air masses relevant to pollution episodes could be identified. Multiple regression analysis was applied to derive statistical relationships between air particulate pollution and meteorological parameters for the winter and summer monsoon periods. For characterisation of major emission sources, chemical compositions of particulate matter were determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis and ion chromatography methods. This topic, however, will be reported elsewhere.

Meteorological conditions
Hanoi is located in the Red River delta in North Vietnam (21.02°N, 105.85°E), about 100 km west of the South China Sea (Figs. 1a and b). Being influenced by the Southeast Asia monsoon regime, the climate is basically tropical and humid. There are two monsoon seasons, i.e. the northeast monsoon in winter and the southeast monsoon in summer.
During winter, atmospheric conditions are alternately affected by air masses from the Highs over Siberia and East China Sea (Fig. 1a) (Toan and Dac, 1993).
Sampling
Coarse (PM2.5−10) and fine (PM2.5) particulates were collected on two separate 47 mm diameter Nuclepore polycarbonate filters using a Gent stack filter unit (SFU) following the instruction manual by Maenhaut et al. (1992). The air sampler head was mounted at 1.6 m above the ground. The flow rate was kept between 18 and 14 l min−1. To mitigate filter clogging an on–off regime was set for the SFU.
The air sampler is located in the Hanoi meteorological garden. The expansion of the city over the last
Surface observation parameters
Surface observation meteorological parameters recorded at every 3-h interval include temperature, pressure, RH, WS, wind direction and sunshine duration. Rainfall was recorded as a 24-h total value. The seasonal averages of meteorological parameters are given in Table 1. For simplicity, the 1 October and 1 May are assigned to the beginning of the winter and summer, respectively. For the summer, only a period from May to July 1999 was analysed. The two summer months of 1998 (August and
24-h particulate concentrations
Figs. 3a–c display the time series of 24-h PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. The annual mean concentrations (±standard errors) from August 1998 to July 1999 were (87.1±3.1) μg m−3 for PM10 and (36.1±1.3) μg m−3 for PM2.5. The PM10 US NAAQS (150 μg m−3) was exceeded on 52 days. Also, PM2.5 concentrations exceed 50 μg m−3 on 77 days. Most of these pollution episodes were observed from October 1998 to February 1999. The time series of 24-h PM2.5−10 and PM2.5 concentrations and some relevant meteorological
Multiple regression analysis method
Meteorological parameters governing the day-to-day variations of PM2.5 and PM2.5−10 for the two monsoon periods were studied by multiple regression analysis. In the regression analysis dependent and independent variables were constructed by logarithmically transforming observation values. The logarithm transformation was necessary because atmospheric dispersion equations suggest that the relationship between particulate concentration (C) and meteorological parameters (Pi) is multiplicative
Summary and conclusion
Continental air masses from the Siberia High take the way to North Vietnam either through the inland of China or on the Pacific Ocean via the Gulf of Tonkin. Inland trajectories, dominating in the first winter period, supply dry air and facilitate the NRIs. In the second winter period cold air parcels mostly travel through the Pacific Ocean, supplying moist air and under anticyclonic conditions near ground STIs occur. During the winter 1998–99, NRIs occurred on 43 days from October to early
