- **Tier**: Tier-1 (Journal of Environmental Sciences)

## Key Findings (Precipitation Paradox)

### 1. Drizzle Paradox Effect
- **Finding**: "drizzle potentially exacerbating PM2.5 pollution under cleaner conditions (≤ 35 µg/m³)"
- **Mechanism**: Light precipitation can increase PM2.5 rather than decrease it under certain conditions

### 2. Seasonal Variation - Spring Paradox
- **Quote**: "In spring, higher PM2.5 levels after drizzle were primarily due to increased organic carbon concentrations favored by higher relative humidity and lower pH conditions compared to other seasons, conducive to secondary organic aerosol production"
- **Mechanism**: High RH + low pH → enhanced SOA formation during drizzle

### 3. Contributing Factors
- Lower wind speeds
- Higher temperatures
- Higher relative humidity
- Lower pH conditions
- These factors contribute to water-soluble organic carbon accumulation

### 4. Day vs Night Effects
- **Quote**: "Daytime and nighttime precipitation exerted differing influences on PM2.5 components, particularly in spring where daytime drizzle and light rain significantly increased PM2.5 and its constituents, notably NO3-, potentially associated with phase distribution changes between gas and aerosol phases in low-temperature, high-RH conditions"
- **Mechanism**: Phase distribution changes between gas and aerosol phases under low-temperature, high-RH conditions

### 5. Dual-Impact Mechanism
- Paper proposes a "dual-impact mechanism of precipitation on PM2.5"
- Precipitation can both remove and enhance PM2.5 depending on conditions

## Relevant Relationships for Extraction

1. **drizzle + clean_conditions → pm25_increase**
   - Conditions: PM2.5 ≤ 35 µg/m³, light precipitation
   
2. **drizzle + high_humidity + low_pH → soa_formation → pm25_increase**
   - Conditions: Spring season, high RH
   
3. **daytime_light_rain + low_temperature + high_humidity → nitrate_increase → pm25_increase**
   - Conditions: Spring, daytime, low-T, high-RH

- Winter: 45.08 µg/m³
- Summer: 41.64 µg/m³
- Autumn: 35.01 µg/m³

### 2. RH Thresholds for Secondary Aerosol Formation

- Under heavy pollution: R = 0.90

### 5. Aqueous-Phase SOC Formation
- **Quote**: "more sensitive to aqueous-phase reactions (daytime R = 0.84; nighttime R = 0.54) than photochemical oxidation (daytime R = 0.23; nighttime R = 0.41) in wintertime"
- **Conditions**: High OX levels (daytime: 130–140 µg/m³; nighttime: 100–140 µg/m³)

### 6. Highlights from Paper
- ALWC contributed 66.68% to PM2.5 with higher mass-based growth factor appearing when RH > 85%

- **Volume**: 685
- **Year**: 2019 (October)
- **DOI**: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.319
- **Tier**: Tier-1

## Key Findings (Fog Effects on PM2.5)

### 1. Fog Scavenging Effect
- **Quote**: "Fog greatly scavenged PM2.5 from the surface to the lower PBL during night of Jan. 2 and morning of Jan.3"
- **Quote**: "The PM2.5 scavenging height was in agreement with the fog top height during the fog process"

### 2. PM2.5 Concentration Changes During Fog
- PM2.5 was strongly scavenged from 150 µg/m³ to 45 µg/m³ during the fog process
- This represents a ~70% reduction

### 3. Vertical Distribution
- Before fog event: PM2.5 concentration slightly higher in stable layer (260 µg/m³) than in residual layer (200 µg/m³)
- During haze period (14:00 LT): PM2.5 well mixed below 500m with concentration of 310 µg/m³
- After fog formed (20:00 LT): PM2.5 scavenged from surface to upper layers

### 4. Turbulence and Fog Development
- **Quote**: "Turbulent mixing enhanced the particle scavenging efficiency of fog droplets by the collision-coalescence process"
- **Quote**: "turbulence development in the fog was the essential dynamic factor driving PM2.5 reduction"

### 5. Fog Formation Conditions
- Fog is reported when visibility < 1 km
- Fog forms when near-surface air is close to saturation (RH approaches 100%)

## Note
This paper shows fog CAN reduce PM2.5 through scavenging - but this is the STANDARD mechanism. Need to find papers about fog INCREASING PM2.5 through aqueous chemistry.

- **Year**: 2022
- **DOI**: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150229
- **Tier**: Tier-1

## Key Findings (From Abstract visible in PDF)

### 1. Fog-Haze Event and PM2.5 Increase
- Study examined heavy haze-fog event during November 2018 in Nanjing, China
- Model underestimates sulfate concentrations by 81% and fails to reproduce the significant increase of sulfate from early morning to noon
- This corresponds to the timing of fog dissipation

### 2. Aqueous-Phase Formation Mechanism
- **Quote**: "the model underestimates the aqueous-phase formation of sulfate in clouds"
- Cloud water content is underestimated which is a pathway for important aqueous-phase reactions

### 3. Sulfate Increase After Fog
- The observed sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and PM2.5 concentrations all increase when fog dissipates
- Sulfate: 23% higher
- Nitrate: 24% higher
- Ammonium: 14% higher
- PM2.5: 17% higher

### 4. Cloud Water Content Effect
- MODIS-corrected cloud water content increases the sulfate by a factor of 3
- Decreases the Normalized Mean Bias (NMB) by 53.5%
- Reproduces diurnal cycle with peak concentration occurring at noon

### 5. Highlights
- Most numerical models generally underestimate sulfate but overestimate nitrate in PM2.5
- Uncertainties in cloud water content can contribute to model biases in simulating sulfate, nitrate and ammonium (SNA)
- The model bias in simulating SNA can be reduced by constraining the modelled cloud water with satellite observations

## Relevant Relationships (Fog Paradox)

1. **fog + so2 → aqueous_phase_oxidation → sulfate_formation → pm25_increase**
   - Conditions: During fog, high cloud water content
   
2. **fog_dissipation → release_of_processed_aerosols → pm25_increase**
   - Mechanism: Aerosols processed in fog droplets are released when fog dissipates
   - Quantitative: 17-24% increase in SIA components

- **Tier**: Tier-1 (ACP)

## Key Findings (Rainfall Rate Thresholds)

### 1. Precipitation Frequency vs Intensity
- **Quote**: "precipitation frequency is more important than precipitation intensity for aerosol wet removal"
- **Quote**: "The scavenging amount modes in the two cases are both smaller than individual rainfall rates associated with the most accumulated rain (rainfall amount mode)"

### 2. Scavenging Amount Mode by Aerosol Size
- Aitken mode: 10-12 mm/d
- Accumulation mode: 8-9 mm/d
- Coarse mode: 7-8 mm/d
- These values are over the tropics

### 3. Geographic Variation
- Scavenging amount mode is generally smaller over land than over ocean
- As latitude increases poleward, the scavenging amount mode decreases substantially
- Over arid/semi-arid regions: scavenging amount mode < 2 mm/d

### 4. Light Rain Importance
- Aerosol burdens are increased globally by reduced climatological mean wet removal of aerosols due to suppressed light rain
- Light rain plays a dominant role in aerosol wet removal

### 5. Stochastic Convection Effect
- With stochastic convection, scavenging amount mode increases
- Most prominent along ITCZ, exceeding 20 mm/d for small particles

## Relevant Relationships (Threshold Effects)

1. **light_precipitation_frequency → aerosol_wet_removal**
   - Mechanism: Frequent light rain more effective than intense but infrequent rain
   
2. **precipitation_rate_threshold → scavenging_efficiency**
   - Threshold varies by aerosol size: 7-12 mm/d for different modes
   
3. **suppressed_light_rain → reduced_wet_removal → aerosol_burden_increase**
   - Mechanism: Reduced frequency of light precipitation leads to accumulation of aerosols
