## Key Findings

### PM2.5 Reductions During Social Distancing
- Urban sites: 18% (soft), 13% (hard) reduction
- Traffic sites: 15% (soft), 14% (hard) reduction
- Weather normalized: 7-10% reduction

### CO Reductions During Social Distancing
- Urban sites: 41% (soft), 29% (hard) reduction
- Traffic sites: 28% (both periods) reduction
- Weather normalized: 5-11% reduction

### Traffic Primary Emissions Reduction
- PM2.5: 37-60% reduction during social distancing
- CO: 33-49% reduction during social distancing

### Key Quotes for Extraction

**Traffic as Major Source**:
> "We hypothesized that transportation is the main emission source for air pollutants in Hanoi"

> "In further analysis, the apparent improvement of air quality in Hanoi during the social distancing period was in line with reducing traffic emissions while emissions from coal-fired power plants remained relatively stable."

**CO and Traffic Relationship**:
> "The observed CO concentrations at traffic sites were double those at urban sites"
> "The diurnal pattern shows two distinct peaks coinciding with the traffic rush hours in Hanoi"
> "It indicated a stringent relation of CO concentrations with road traffic emissions"

**Traffic Contribution**:
> "The calculated reductions of traffic primary emissions during social distancing periods in Hanoi were 37–60% and 33–49% for PM2.5 and CO, respectively."

> "The results also showed the potential of reduction by almost 10% in ambient levels of PM2.5 and CO if the volume of transportation reduced by 60% and in the absence of bus operation."

**Multiple Sources for PM2.5**:
> "No clear traffic rush-hour peaks were observed for PM2.5 even at roadside sites" - indicating PM2.5 has multiple sources beyond traffic

> "High correlation, r > 0.80 for all sites, demonstrated the strong effects of regional sources on PM2.5 levels"

**Coal Power Plants**:
> "emissions from coal-fired power plants remained relatively stable" during social distancing

### Study Details
- **Location**: 9 monitoring stations in Hanoi (urban and traffic sites)
- **Period**: March 1 - May 30, 2020
- **Method**: Random Forest model for weather normalization
- **Data**: Hourly PM2.5 and CO concentrations

### Mechanisms Identified
1. Traffic reduction → Direct PM2.5 and CO reduction
2. Weather conditions affect pollutant dispersion
3. Long-range transport contributes to PM2.5 (regional sources)
4. Coal power plants contribute to background pollution
