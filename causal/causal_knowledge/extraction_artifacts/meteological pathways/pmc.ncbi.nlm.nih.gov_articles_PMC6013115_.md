Abstract

Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) deposition which involves both dry and wet processes is an important means of controlling air pollution. To investigate the characteristics of dry and wet deposition in wetlands, PM concentrations and meteorological conditions were monitored during summer at heights of 1.5 m, 6 m and 10 m above ground level at Cuihu Wetland (Beijing, China) in order to assess the efficiency of PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic size of <2.5 μm) and PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic size of <10 μm) removal. The results showed: Daily concentrations of PM, dry deposition velocities and fluxes changed with the same variation trend. The daily average deposition velocity for PM10 (3.19 ± 1.18 cm·s–1) was almost 10 times that of PM2.5 (0.32 ± 0.33 cm·s–1). For PM2.5, the following dry deposition fluxes were recorded: 10 m (0.170 ± 0.463 μg·m–2·s–1) > 6 m (0.007 ± 0.003 μg·m–2·s–1) > 1.5 m (0.005 ± 0.002 μg·m–2·s–1). And the following deposition fluxes for PM10 were recorded: 10 m (2.163 ± 2.941 μg·m–2·s–1) > 1.5 m (1.565 ± 0.872 μg·m–2·s–1) > 6 m (0.987 ± 0.595 μg·m–2·s–1). In the case of wet deposition, the relative deposition fluxes for PM2.5 and PM10 were 1.5 m > 10 m > 6 m, i.e. there was very little difference between the fluxes for PM2.5 (0.688 ± 0.069 μg·m–2·s–1) and for PM10 (0.904 ± 0.103 μg·m–2·s–1). It was also noted that rainfall intensity and PM diameter influenced wet deposition efficiency. Dry deposition (63%) was more tilted towards removing PM10 than was the case for wet deposition (37%). In terms of PM2.5 removal, wet deposition (92%) was found to be more efficient.

Introduction

The frequent occurrence of particulate matter (PM) pollution has led to many problems [1,2]. The emission of PM is one of the most important factors affecting climate [2] and health [3,4]. The presence of PM2.5 is thought to have caused premature mortality in 1.27 million individuals in China [5,6]. Likewise, PM10 may increase the risk of premature death [7] due to cardiovascular [8] and respiratory diseases [9].

Atmospheric deposition is an important means of controlling air pollution [10]. Atmospheric PM deposition involves both dry and wet processes. Dry deposition refers to the deposition of particles or gases from the atmosphere through the direct delivery of mass to the surface (i.e. via non-precipitation) [11]. On the other hand, wet processes are often referred to as rain or snow scavenging [12], with rain scavenging PM being generally classified as ‘rainout particles’ (serving as cloud-condensation nuclei or undergoing capture by cloud water) and as ‘washout’ (i.e. removal of below-cloud particles by raindrops as they fall) [13].

Studies have confirmed that dry deposition has the capacity to remove PM [14–16] and that the process of dry deposition is influenced by spatial fluctuations, surface-type differences, temporal changes, diurnal variations and meteorological conditions [14]. Wet deposition is also an important mechanism for reducing air pollution by the removal of PM [15]. A study showed that wet deposition accounted for 54–71% of PM1–20 (particles with 1–20 μm diameter) deposition and it accounted for 76–86% of PM0.5–20 (particles with 0.5–20 μm diameter) deposition [12]. According to a case study carried out in Guangzhou (China), the total annual flux of wet and dry depositions, representing the combined results for PM deposition in the urban area, was 34 g·m–2·yr–1, with 50% being attributed by wet deposition [15]. Therefore, dry and wet depositions can be regarded as important pathways for the elimination of PM from ambient air.

Wetlands are important ecological systems that perform vital ecological functions. A number of studies have demonstrated that wetlands play a role in reducing PM [17,18]. Considerable research attention has been focused on dry deposition as well as comparisons between various surface types [17,18]. Space–time variation has also been the focus of some studies. For example, PM2.5 and PM10 dry deposition fluxes at 10 m were higher than those measured at 6 m [16]. And deposition fluxes measured during the dry period (1.03 μg·m–2·s–1) were higher than those during the wet period (0.003 μg·m–2·s–1) and during normal humidity conditions (0.02 μg·m–2·s–1) [16]. Very little work has been carried out on the the ecological functions associated with dry and wet deposition in wetlands.

This study investigated the temporal and spatial variations in dry and wet deposition velocity in wetlands and compared the deposition fluxes of dry and wet deposition in order to assess the efficiency of PM2.5 and PM10 removal.

Materials and methods
Experimental sites

Cuihu National Urban Wetland Park (1.57 km2; 1.9 km × 1.2 km) is situated north of the Shangzhuang Reservoir, Haidian District, Beijing (Fig 1), which is in a warm temperate semi-humid monsoon climate zone. The annual average temperature is 12.38°C and the annual precipitation is 500–700 mm, 60% of which is concentrated in the wet summer period (July and August) [16]. The experiment was carried out on the “crane island” (116°19′E, 40°10′N) in Cuihu National Urban Wetland Park as shown in Fig 1.

Dry deposition

Particle concentration data parameters (TSP, PM10 and PM2.5) were measured using Dustmate (Turnkey Co. Ltd, UK). The using of Dustmate for collecting the PM concentration was given in previous studies [16, 17, 18] and all above these researches have successfully used this instrument. Meteorological data (wind speed, temperature and relative humidity) were collected by a weather station (Nielsen-Kellerman Co. Ltd, USA). Both the Dustmate and the weather station were mounted at three height levels, which were 1.5 m (the average plant height in the wetland), 6 m (dry deposition layer) and 10 m (stable layer) above ground level. The sampling time was from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm during summer (June–August) in 2016. The reason for the summer sampling was the rainfall concentrated in summer and we could contrast dry deposition and wet deposition on this basis.

Wet deposition

The sampling time was the summer (June–August) of 2016. Rainfall events of greater than 8 h of duration were chosen to represent wet deposition in order to studied the process of wet deposition under longer rainfall and compared it with the dry deposition process. Rain collectors which were located at 1.5 m, 6 m and 10 m collected rainwater every 0.5 h to provide information on volume and intensity. A Dustmate system was used to measure particle concentration during rainfall events.
