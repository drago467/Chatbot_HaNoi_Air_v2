Abstract
Three years of measurement of PM2.5 with 5-min time resolution was conducted from 2005 to 2007 in urban and rural environments in Beijing to study the seasonal and diurnal variations in PM2.5 concentration. Pronounced seasonal variation was observed in the urban area, with the highest concentrations typically observed in the winter and the lowest concentrations generally found in the summer. In the rural area, the maximum in PM2.5 concentration usually appeared during the spring, followed by a second maximum in the summer, while the minimum generally occurred in the winter. Significant diurnal variations in PM2.5 concentration were observed in both urban and rural areas. In the urban area, the PM2.5 concentration displays a bimodal pattern, with peaks between 7:00 and 8:00 a.m. and between 7:00 and 11:00 p.m. The minimum generally appears around noon. The morning peak is attributed to enhanced anthropogenic activity during rush hours. The decreases of boundary layer height and wind speed in the afternoon companying with increased source activity during the afternoon rush hour result in the highest PM2.5 concentration during evening hours. In the rural area, the PM2.5 concentration shows a unimodal pattern with a significant peak between 5:00 and 11:00 p.m.
The seasonal and diurnal variations in PM2.5 concentration in the urban area are mostly dominated by the seasonal and diurnal variability of boundary layer and source emissions. The year-to-year variability of rainfall also has an important influence on the seasonal variation of PM2.5 in the urban area. The seasonal and diurnal wind patterns are more important factors for PM2.5 variation in the rural area. Southerly winds carry pollutants emitted in southern urban areas northward and significantly enhance the PM2.5 concentration level in the rural area.
Introduction
Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) affects climate, environment, visibility and health through a great variety of processes (Pope et al., 2002). PM can be classified by size into PM10 and PM2.5 with mass median aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm and 2.5 μm, respectively. Measurements of PM10 have already been performed in Beijing since 1999 for air quality monitoring purposes, and high concentrations of PM10 are frequently recorded in the urban atmosphere of Beijing (http://www.bjepb.gov.cn). With rapid urbanization and corresponding increases in traffic and energy consumption, there has been growing evidence that the ambient concentration level of PM2.5 is also high in Beijing's urban atmosphere (He et al., 2001, Wang et al., 2005). As PM2.5 is associated with more adverse health effects than larger particles, measuring PM2.5 is highly important (Wilson and Suh, 1997).
In Europe and the United States, PM2.5 has been measured widely for several years. In China, studies of PM2.5 have focused mainly on its chemical composition, including elemental constituents, major inorganic ions, and organic compounds (He et al., 2001, Ye et al., 2003, Guo et al., 2003). The first comprehensive study of PM2.5 in Beijing was done by Chen et al. (1994) in 1989–1990. The average concentration of PM2.5 for four seasons was reported to be in the 70–90 μg m−3 range. After ten years, the average concentration of PM2.5 increased significantly following rapid economic development. In 2000, the annual average concentration of PM2.5 measured at five sites in Beijing was 101 μg m−3 (Zheng et al., 2005a), similar to the average value reported by He et al. (2001) of 115 μg m−3 at the Chegongzhuang site and 127 μg m−3 at the Tsinghua site. These levels are much higher than those found in Europe and the United States. In comparison, the measured annual average concentration of PM2.5 is only about 12 μg m−3 in the United States from 2000 to 2007 (http://www.epa.gov/airtrends/pm.html), and levels range from 8 to 25 μg m−3 regionally in Switzerland in 1998–2001 and 6–10 μg m−3 in Finland in 1999–2001 (Gehrig and Buchmann, 2003, Laakso et al., 2003). Such high concentrations of airborne fine particles in Beijing could have significant adverse impacts on visibility and health. There have been several investigations into the chemical composition and emission sources of PM2.5 in Beijing (Dan et al., 2004, Sun et al., 2004, Huang et al., 2006, Zheng et al., 2005a, Zheng et al., 2005b, Duan et al., 2006, Song et al., 2007). These studies have revealed that SO42−, NO3−, NH4+, organic matter, crustal matter, and elemental carbon are the dominant species composing PM2.5 in Beijing. The major sources of PM2.5 are determined as dust, secondary aerosol, coal combustion, traffic exhausts and biomass burning, etc. A new result reported by Guinot et al. (2007) was that coal combustion appeared no more marked increase in PM2.5 concentration during the heating season, which may enlighten recent abatement policies regarding coal quality and coal usage. The regional contributions to PM2.5 in Beijing have been examined with large-scale chemical-meteorological models and analytical techniques. During southerly wind flow, about 70% of PM2.5 can be attributed to sources outside Beijing (Streets et al., 2007, Jia et al., 2008). However, previously reported measurements have mostly used filter-based measurement techniques, focused on chemical compositions or source appointment of PM2.5. The seasonal and diurnal variations of PM2.5 concentration are poorly understood. Wang et al. (2004) monitored PM2.5 in urban area during four representative months of 2001 and reported PM2.5 concentrations of 79–138 μg m−3 with significant seasonal variation. The diurnal variation of PM2.5 was also observed with higher concentration at night and lower value in the daytime, the minimum generally found in the early afternoon. However, this work focused on short events and was limited to urban area. The information and relevant actions are still not sufficient to fully control fine particulate pollution and formulate air quality standards because of lack of long-term and continuous observation of PM2.5 in such a rapidly developing region.
In this study, the mass concentration of PM2.5 has been measured continuously at an urban site and a rural site in Beijing for three years (2005–2007). Using these observations, we analyze seasonal and diurnal variations in PM2.5 concentration, the difference in PM2.5 behavior between urban and rural areas, and the influence of meteorological conditions on PM2.5 behavior. Bettering understanding of the temporal variations of PM2.5 and the influences of meteorological conditions and emissions is helpful in formulating control measures of fine particulate air pollution and establishing air quality standards for PM2.5 in the Beijing area. Moreover, documentation of diurnal variation of PM2.5 concentration is significant from an environmental perspective due to different human exposure to ambient air in night and daytime.

Site description
Beijing Municipality is located on the northwestern border of the North China Plain and is bounded by mountains on the north, east, and west (Fig. 1a). As shown in Fig. 1a, Beijing is close to many heavily populated and industrialized cities, including Tianjin Municipality, Shijiazhuang and Tangshan in Hebei province, and Taiyuan and Datong in Shanxi province. Beijing is also frequently affected, particularly in the spring, by air masses from the Gobi desert approximately 400 km to the
Results and discussion
From January 2005 to December 2007, totals of 25,398 and 23,241 hourly mean values of PM2.5 concentration were obtained at BL and SDZ, respectively. Meteorological data, including temperature, relative humidity (RH), wind speed, wind direction, and rainfall, were collected simultaneously. The daily mean PM2.5 concentrations and meteorological parameters were calculated from the hourly values and used to obtain monthly and seasonal averages.
Conclusion
Extensive measurements of PM2.5 concentrations over three years, from 2005 to 2007, were conducted in urban and rural environments in Beijing. Serious fine particulate pollution exists not only in the urban area but also in the rural area, with the USEPA NAAQS criterion of 15 μg m−3 for average annual PM2.5 concentration exceeded over all three years in both urban and rural areas.
Significant seasonal variations are observed at both urban and rural sites. In the urban area, the highest PM2.5
