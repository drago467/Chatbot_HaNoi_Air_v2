## Key Findings

### Mechanism: Temperature Inversion → PM2.5 Accumulation in Hanoi

This is a foundational paper specifically about Hanoi, Vietnam, providing direct evidence for the temperature inversion → PM2.5 relationship.

1. **Nocturnal radiation inversions cause high PM2.5**: "Very high PM2.5 and PM2.5−10 concentrations were observed in conjunction with the occurrence of nocturnal radiation inversions from October to December"

2. **Subsidence temperature inversions (STI) cause high PM2.5**: "subsidence temperature inversions (STI) from January to March" also associated with high PM2.5

3. **Diurnal variation under radiation inversions**: "In the first case, the PM2.5−10 fraction was much enhanced and particulate pollution was significantly higher at night than in daytime"

4. **Seasonal variation**: "In summer (May–September) particulate pollution was much lower than in winter"

5. **Key meteorological determinants**: "the most important determinants of PM2.5 are wind speed and air temperature"

6. **Turbulence parameters**: "among the determinants of 24-h particulate concentrations are the vertical gradients of potential temperature and wind speed recorded at 06.30 and 18.30"

7. **Explained variance**: "Meteorological parameters could explain from 60% to 74% of the day-to-day variations of particulate concentrations"

### Key Quotes
- "Very high PM2.5 and PM2.5−10 concentrations were observed in conjunction with the occurrence of nocturnal radiation inversions from October to December and subsidence temperature inversions (STI) from January to March"
- "particulate pollution was significantly higher at night than in daytime"
- "the most important determinants of PM2.5 are wind speed and air temperature"

### Causal Chain Extracted (Hanoi-specific)
1. `nocturnal_radiation_cooling` → `temperature_inversion` (October-December)
2. `subsidence` → `temperature_inversion` (January-March)
3. `temperature_inversion` → `reduced_vertical_mixing` → `pm25` (accumulation)

### Conditions
- **Time**: Nighttime (for radiation inversions)
- **Season**: Winter (October-March) - highest PM2.5
- **Location**: Hanoi, Vietnam (Red River Delta)
- **Climate**: Southeast Asia monsoon regime

### Relevance to Cloud Cover
This paper establishes the baseline mechanism for Hanoi:
- Nocturnal radiation cooling (enhanced by clear skies/low cloud cover) → stronger inversions → higher PM2.5
- This is consistent with Hu et al. 2021 findings about cloud cover modulating radiation cooling
