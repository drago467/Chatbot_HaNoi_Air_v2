Abstract

Fine-particle pollution associated with high sulfate and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) contents still occurs in winter, despite considerable reductions in precursor emissions in China. The chemical mechanisms involved are consistently acknowledged to be linked with aerosol water but remain poorly understood. Here, we present findings demonstrating that the synergistic effect of elevated aerosol water content and particles originating from fossil fuel combustion significantly enhanced the rapid formation of sulfate and SOAs under high humidity conditions during winter in northern China. The presence of high aerosol water content promoted the aging process of particles containing elemental carbon (EC) and facilitated the formation of SOAs. Evidence from single particles reveals an increased potential for SOA formation from primary organic aerosols (POAs) originating from fossil fuel combustion, in the presence of increasing aerosol water. Under conditions of relative humidity exceeding 85%, the multiphase oxidation of SO2 by in-particle nitrite/nitrous acid, generated through reactions involving aged EC-containing and iron-rich particles, as well as aqueous-phase formation of hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS), led to a substantial increase in sulfate production. This study emphasizes the critical role of aerosol water in the aerosol chemistry concerning sulfate and SOAs, highlighting the urgent necessity to mitigate primary emissions from fossil fuel combustion.

Introduction

Severe haze pollution has been effectively alleviated in China due to the substantial reduction in primary air pollutant emissions over the past two decades1. Nevertheless, during winter, rapid formation of sulfate and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) still occurs, exacerbating the development of severe haze2,3,4. The formation of sulfate is governed by intricate and robust chemical feedback associated with oxidants, aerosol pH, and meteorological conditions5. Sulfate can be formed through various pathways of SO2 oxidation, including gas-phase oxidation by hydroxyl radical (OH), aqueous-phase oxidation involving H2O2, O2 catalyzed by transition-metal ions (TMI), NO2, and organic hydroperoxides6,7,8,9. The air quality models incorporating these oxidation pathways still fail to adequately address the observed rapid SO2 oxidation chemistry, and the missing sulfate is likely attributed to multiphase oxidation processes involving aerosol water3,7. SOAs are formed either through the condensation of gas-phase oxidized organic compounds with low volatility onto particles4,10 or via particle-phase oxidation processing11,12. These two pathways were influenced by various factors associated with uptake and chemical reactions, including ambient relative humidity (RH), aerosol liquid water content (LWC), aerosol pH, and ambient temperature13. The enhanced formation of SOAs, an overwhelming composition of organic aerosols (OAs) during haze pollution, is primarily attributed to favorable chemical processes facilitated by increasing aerosol water2,4,14,15.

Aerosol water, acting as both a medium and reactant in the multiphase reactions, exerts significant influence on gas-particle transformations through intricate physical and chemical mechanisms16,17,18. An increase in aerosol water thermodynamic reversibly favors the dissolution of reactive inorganic or organic gases into the aqueous phase by elevating their effective Henry’s law constants, and irreversibly drives gas uptake by enhancing in-particle reactions19,20. The dominant mechanisms responsible for sulfate formation exhibit dynamic evolution, influenced by factors such as LWC, aerosol pH and oxidants7. In conditions characterized by high LWC and weakly acidic or neutral aerosol pH (>5.5), the aqueous oxidation of SO2 by dissolved NO2 and nitrous acid (HONO) is favored21; whereas manganese-catalyzed oxidation on particle surfaces predominates in sulfate formation under low LWC and a pH range of 4–58,22. Aerosol water also facilitates surface-mediated processes, potentially by creating aqueous solution environments on the surface and thereby lowering the energy barrier of reactions, or by providing a bridge for electron-transfer reactions23. In wet particles, hydrophobic elemental carbon (EC) can actively participate in in-particle chemical processes and effectively catalyze the oxidation of SO224. For SOAs, the presence of aerosol water may play a crucial role in modulating precursors partitioning into the liquid phase and facilitating their oxidation within the aqueous phase, thereby dynamically influencing SOA formation4,10,14. Improving the understanding of aerosol water and its potential role in sulfate and SOA formation is crucial for elucidating the fundamental chemical processes governing haze pollution, particularly during winter when atmospheric oxidation capacity is relatively limited.

In this study, we conducted comprehensive field observations to characterize the aerosol chemical components in terms of both bulk and single particles during winter. The field study was conducted through the synchronous use of online instruments, including ion chromatography (IC) systems, single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS), and differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS), during Jan.–Feb. 2022 in Tai’an, a city at the foot of Mount Tai that is affected by the vagaries of weather in northern China25,26. Our findings revealed that elevated LWC and fossil fuel combustion emissions synergistically contributed to the enhanced sulfate and SOA formation under high RH conditions during winter. This study advances our understanding of the primary drivers behind the formation of secondary aerosols during winter haze pollution and provides valuable insights for devising effective mitigation strategies.

Particle pollution processes evolve with humidity and emissions

Five particle growth episodes (labeled as Ep I to V and depicted with circles in Fig. 1a) occurred during the observation period, all exhibiting dynamic evolutions in response to variations in RH (Supplementary Fig. 1). Compared with the low average RH of 32% during the clean period (Cp), the RH values during Ep I to V were 88%, 64%, 56%, 45%, and 42%, respectively (Fig. 1b). Highly consistent with these RH levels, the average PM2.5 mass concentrations during Ep I to V were 104.7, 101.7, 81.7, 50.9, and 48.9 μg m−3, respectively, representing 2.0–4.3 times that during Cp. However, an inconsistency was observed between the mass concentration and particle number (N) of PM2.5 in the five pollution episodes. This discrepancy may be attributed to differentiated physical and chemical processes governing particle formation between these episodes, which were driven by differences in RH and manifested by distinctive single particle types and particle sizes (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figs. 1–3).

The single particles collected using SPAMS in this study revealed the ubiquitous presence of particles containing EC, which constitutes a complex mixture of compounds formed from incomplete combustion of diverse fuels (e.g., predominantly coal, gasoline and diesel vehicles, and biomass in China)27,28,29. The EC-containing particles constituted an average proportion of 62% of the total particles and reached up to 75% during Ep I, highlighting the significant contribution of fuel combustion activities to winter haze pollution in Tai’an city. Under varying atmospheric conditions, these EC-containing particles would undergo diverse degrees of aging, thereby exerting intricate influences on the atmospheric physical and chemical processes, environment, and climate. The number fraction of fresh and aged EC-containing particles (defined in “Methods” section and characterized in Fig. 1c) responded oppositely to variations in RH. The aged EC-containing particles accounted for 59% and 45% of total particles during Ep I and II, respectively, whereas they constituted a minority during Cp (16%). These aged particles were likely primarily derived from the aging process of fresh EC-containing particles, either through hygroscopic growth and heterogeneous reactions on particle surfaces or via aqueous-phase processing in particle droplets. Moreover, on average, the fossil fuel combustion-derived POAs (namely ECOCCN particles, abbreviated as FC-POAs in “Methods” section) accounted for 70% of the total combustion-derived POAs (i.e., the sum of ECOCCN and KOCCN), while biomass burning derived POAs (namely KOCCN particles, defined in “Methods” section) constituted 30%. During Ep I and Ep II, FC-POAs exhibited a fractional contribution of 83% and 75%, respectively, which was significantly higher than other periods (ranging from 64% to 69%). These results imply a crucial role of fuel combustion, particularly that of fossil fuels, in the formation of winter haze pollution.

Comparable PM2.5 mass concentrations were observed during Ep I and II, yet their chemical compositions exhibited distinct characteristics. This distinction was primarily manifested by the explosive growth of SO42− but constant NO3− mass concentration during Ep I, whereas Ep II witnessed a cumulative formation of NO3− dominating the composition with a slow increase in SO42− (Supplementary Fig. 1). There are two primary factors contributing to this distinction. Firstly, the RH was higher during Ep I compared to Ep II. The sustained elevated RH (>85%) during Ep I largely promoted moisture uptake of particles. Under such high RH conditions, heterogeneous and aqueous chemical processes were strengthened, as evidenced by the presence of larger particle sizes and a significant amount of particles containing hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS; m/z −111[HOCH2SO3−]) during Ep I (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 4). Secondly, during Ep I, there was a higher abundance of EC-containing and Fe-rich particles (particularly those containing oxalate) compared to Ep II (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 4). These particles may have facilitated the oxidation of SO224,30, leading to the rapid formation of secondary sulfate. In addition, periods with low RHs also exhibited a high particle number despite a low mass concentration of sulfate. During these periods, a large proportion of the sulfate may have originated from fresh emissions from combustion, as indicated by the higher fractions of ECOCCN and KOCCN particles, which exhibited prominent peaks at m/z −97[HSO4−] in their mass spectra (Fig. 1d).

Enhancement of aerosol water and sulfate driven by high humidity

The aerosol LWC exhibited an exponential increase with rising RH, and this increase was more sharply at higher levels of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs; i.e., sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium) (Fig. 2a). Notably, the LWC doubled as the RH increased from 80–85% to 85–90% (Fig. 2b). This indicates the existence of a positive feedback loop triggered by elevated RH between particle hygroscopicity, LWC, and hydrophilic chemical components (i.e., inorganic and water-soluble organic aerosols), which eventually yields high concentrations of PM2.531. The viscosity and diffusivity of reactive substances highly depend on RH32. As RH increases and approaches or exceeds the deliquescence RH (DRH) of inorganic species, a moisture-induced phase transition from a semisolid state to a liquid state occurs in the particles31,33. The DRH values of NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4 are 76.6% and 81.8%33, respectively, at 0 °C, which is close to the mean temperature during the field study period. It is worth noting that the phase state transition occurs at RH values slightly below the DRH due to the presence of multicomponent mixtures in atmospheric particles33,34. An RH of approximately 68% was reported as a threshold of transition from a semisolid to liquid state in winter in Beijing35. The presence of liquid-state particles can facilitate the uptake, mass transfer and multiphase chemical reactions of reactive trace gases, thereby promoting the formation of secondary aerosols and facilitating rapid growth in both aerosol mass and LWC; in turn, this facilitation can be further enhanced as the LWC increases31,36. Both Ep I and II developed under high RH conditions and were accompanied by obvious increases in the LWC and SIAs (Supplementary Fig. 5). During Ep I, the RH remained approaching 90%, indicating a liquid state of the particles and their ability to absorb abundant water. In contrast, during Ep II, the RH exhibited a gradual increase from 39% to 86%, indicating a potential phase transition from a semisolid to a liquid state due to the reduction in particle rebound fraction under increasing LWC and SIAs31,36. This may account for the lower LWC observed during Ep II compared to Ep I, despite comparable SIAs concentrations between the two periods (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 5).
