## Key Findings

### Aqueous-Phase SOA (aqSOA) Formation
This comprehensive review establishes that SOA formation in cloud and aerosol water (aqSOA) is a significant but often overlooked pathway for organic aerosol production.

**Key mechanisms:**
1. Water-soluble organic compounds undergo chemical reactions in cloud/fog droplets
2. Products include dicarboxylic acids and "humic-like substances" (oligomers, high-molecular-weight compounds)
3. These compounds have no gas-phase sources but comprise significant fraction of total SOA mass

**Quantitative Findings:**
- aqSOA might contribute **almost as much mass as gasSOA** to the SOA budget
- Highest contributions from biogenic VOC emissions in presence of anthropogenic pollutants (NOx)
- High relative humidity and cloudiness enhance aqSOA formation

### Conditions Favoring aqSOA
- High relative humidity (RH)
- Presence of clouds/fog
- Biogenic VOC emissions + anthropogenic NOx
- Aqueous processing in droplet mode

### Products
- Dicarboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid)
- Humic-like substances (HULIS)
- Oligomers and high-molecular-weight compounds

## Relevant Quotes
> "aqSOA might contribute almost as much mass as gasSOA to the SOA budget, with highest contributions from biogenic emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the presence of anthropogenic pollutants (i.e. NOx) at high relative humidity and cloudiness."

> "The formation of SOA in cloud and aerosol water (aqSOA) is not considered in these models even though water is an abundant medium for atmospheric chemistry."

> "There is direct evidence from field observations and laboratory studies that organic aerosol is formed in cloud and aerosol water, contributing substantial mass to the droplet mode."

## Applicability to Hanoi/Vietnam
- High humidity conditions in tropical monsoon climate
- Frequent fog/cloud events during winter
- Mix of biogenic and anthropogenic emissions
- Relevant for understanding PM2.5 formation during high-RH periods
