### Key Findings:

**1. Light precipitation (0.1-0.5 mm) INCREASES PM2.5:**
- Quote: "For precipitation events with amount of 0.1–0.5 mm, PM2.5 mass concentration increased with precipitation amount with a rate of 0.85 μg/m³ per 0.1 mm (r = +0.91, p < 0.05)"
- Mechanism: "aerosol hygroscopic growth and gas-particle conversion increase aerosol amount"
- Locator: Section 3.3, Figure 8a

**2. Medium precipitation (0.5-10 mm) - No clear effect:**
- Quote: "For precipitation events with amount of 0.5–10 mm, there were no clear relationships between precipitation amount and PM2.5 mass concentration"
- Mechanism: "precipitation scavenging effect increases with the increasing precipitation amount, which competes with the effect of hygroscopic growth and secondary formation of aerosols"
- Locator: Section 3.3, Figure 8b

**3. Heavy precipitation (>10 mm) DECREASES PM2.5:**
- Quote: "For precipitation events with amount larger than 10 mm, PM2.5 mass concentration significantly decreased with precipitation amount with a rate of 0.17 μg/m³ per 1 mm"
- Mechanism: "precipitation scavenging effect plays the dominant role"
- Locator: Section 3.3, Figure 8c

**4. Scavenging mechanisms:**
- Quote: "Precipitation scavenging includes in-cloud and below-cloud scavenging mechanisms. The three most important removal mechanisms in below-cloud-scavenging process are Brownian diffusion, interception, and inertial impaction, which wash out the aerosol particles from the atmosphere"
- Locator: Section 1 (Introduction)

**5. Effect depends on initial PM2.5 level:**
- Quote: "When the PM2.5 mass concentration before precipitation was ≤35 μg/m³, all types of precipitation, even including heavy precipitation, can enhance PM2.5 mass concentration"
- Quote: "With the increase of aerosol pollution, the scavenging efficiency also increases, making PM2.5 more prone to decrease"
- Locator: Section 3.4

**6. Duration threshold:**
- Quote: "Light precipitation with duration time less than 1 hr and amount less than 0.5 mm increases the PM2.5 mass concentration"
- Quote: "Heavy precipitation with duration time less than 1 hr and amount larger than 10 mm decreases the PM2.5 mass concentration"
