Abstract

Severe events of wintertime particulate air pollution in Beijing (winter haze) are associated with high relative humidity (RH) and fast production of particulate sulfate from the oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emitted by coal combustion. There has been considerable debate regarding the mechanism for SO2 oxidation. Here we show evidence from field observations of a haze event that rapid oxidation of SO2 by nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrous acid (HONO) takes place, the latter producing nitrous oxide (N2O). Sulfate shifts to larger particle sizes during the event, indicative of fog/cloud processing. Fog and cloud readily form under winter haze conditions, leading to high liquid water contents with high pH (>5.5) from elevated ammonia. Such conditions enable fast aqueous-phase oxidation of SO2 by NO2, producing HONO which can in turn oxidize SO2 to yield N2O.This mechanism could provide an explanation for sulfate formation under some winter haze conditions.

Introduction

Beijing experiences severe air pollution events in winter, commonly called winter haze. The concentration of fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM2.5) can exceed 200 μg m−3 on a 24-h average basis during these events1, considerably higher than the 24-h Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 75 μg m−3. Winter haze events are often associated with high relative humidity (RH)2,3,4,5 and a major contribution of sulfate to total PM2.56. Sulfate is produced in the atmosphere by oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emitted from coal combustion7,8. But the photochemical oxidants known to drive atmospheric oxidation of SO2 (hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, ozone) have very low concentrations under typical winter haze conditions7,9,10. This has led to considerable debate regarding the mechanisms responsible for sulfate formation in winter haze9,11,12,13.

The high-RH conditions characteristic of winter haze cause particulate matter to take up water, enabling aqueous-phase pathways for SO2 oxidation. SO2 is a weak acid with moderate water solubility (Henry’s law constant KH = 1.2 M atm−1 at 298 K) that dissociates in water to form bisulfite (HSO3−; pKa,1 = 1.9 at 298 K) and sulfite (SO32−; pKa,2 = 7.2 at 298 K). Bisulfite and sulfite are converted to sulfate by a number of aqueous-phase oxidants with rates dependent on pH14. As the air cools at night or through rising motions the haze can turn to fog and low clouds (RH > 100%), increasing the atmospheric liquid water content (LWC) by orders of magnitude and hence the importance of SO2 aqueous-phase oxidation pathways.

Most previous studies of sulfate formation during Beijing haze events have focused on mechanisms taking place in the ubiquitous haze particles (RH < 100%) rather than in the more sporadic fog and cloud (RH > 100%)13,15,16,17. Haze particles are concentrated aqueous solutions with pH that can be estimated from standard thermodynamics18. Aqueous-phase oxidation of SO2 by nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in haze has been proposed9,11,13, with NO2 originating from vehicular emissions, but requires higher pH than the 4–5 range inferred from thermodynamic calculations19,20,21. Some studies have suggested that oxidation by NO2 would be enhanced by fog9,13,17. Aqueous-phase autoxidation of SO2 by molecular oxygen catalyzed by transition metal ions (TMI) has been proposed22,23 but is poorly constrained due to the lack of information on TMI concentration, complexation, and solubility24. A recent study suggests that aqueous-phase oxidation by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in haze could be significant10. Yet another suggestion is that some of the reported sulfate could actually be hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) produced by in-cloud complexation of HSO3− and SO32− with formaldehyde (HCHO)25,26.

Here we present detailed chemical observations during a Beijing haze event in December 2016 where PM2.5 concentrations reached 400 μg m−3. We observe fast sulfate production as RH increases over the course of the event, leading to extensive nighttime fog and low clouds, and find a concurrent increase of nitrous oxide (N2O). N2O is a product of aqueous-phase SO2 oxidation by dissolved nitrous acid (HONO)27,28,29, and observations of HONO during the event support this sulfate formation mechanism. Most of the HONO appears in turn to be produced by aqueous-phase SO2 oxidation by NO2, leading us to propose a two-step fog-enabled mechanism for sulfate formation during winter haze events.

Results
Field observations

Figure 1 shows the time series of selected variables measured at our field site on the rooftop of an Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) building in urban Beijing during December 4–22, 2016. The start of the campaign on December 4 sampled the end of a haze event that terminated on December 5 with passage of a cold front. Variable conditions were observed during December 6–15 (data not shown). An extended haze event then developed over the December 16–22 period, with 24-h average PM2.5 exceeding 200 μg m−3 for 6 successive days before a cold front swept in with clean air on December 22.

The figure shows the time series of meteorological parameters and chemical species measured in Beijing on December 4–22, 2016. The measurements were made from the roof of an Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) building except for liquid water content (LWC) measured at the Beijing Observatory of the China Meteorological Administration 20 km to the southeast, and PM2.5 concentration measured at the Beijing Olympic Center Observatory 4 km to the northeast. UTC+8 denotes Coordinated Universal Time + 8 h and represents local solar time in hours. a 10-m wind speed (WS) and mixing layer height (MLH) above ground level (AGL). b LWC and relative humidity (RH); c N2O and HONO concentrations; d PM1 nitrate and NO2 concentrations; e PM1 sulfate and SO2 concentrations; f ozone (O3) and ammonia (NH3) concentrations; and g black carbon (BC) and PM2.5 concentrations. The campaign sampled the tail end of a haze event on December 4, terminated by passage of a cold front on December 5 and followed by variable conditions on December 6–15 (not shown, note break in time axis). It then sampled an extended pollution episode on December 16–22 with initially moderate RH of 40–75% (Stage I), followed by high RH (>75%) including dense nighttime fog at the Beijing Observatory (Stage II), and ending on December 22 with the passage of a cold front. Nighttime periods are shaded. Sulfate and nitrate measurements are from the HR-AMS instrument with a size cut of 1-μm diameter (see text).

Wind speed during the December 16–22 haze event was persistently low in the range of 0.3–1.5 m s−1 and the mixed layer height (MLH) was less than 600 m above ground level (AGL), decreasing to 300 m at night. The early part of the event on December 16–19 (labeled Stage I in Fig. 1) had moderate RH in the 40–75% range. On December 20–21 (Stage II) the RH rose to above 75% as temperatures cooled to an average of 271 K at night, and dense nighttime fog with LWC as high as 0.5 g m−3 was observed at the Beijing Observatory meteorological station 20 km to the south (Fig. 1). Beijing International Airport also reported fog during that period (Supplementary Fig. 1). Dense fog was not observed at our site, but the visibility dropped below a few hundred meters and low clouds formed just 50 m above ground (Supplementary Fig. 2).

PM2.5 concentrations rose to over 400 μg m−3 during the high-RH period (Stage II) in concert with a rise in sulfate, while nitrate remained at the same concentration as in Stage I (47 μg m−3). Black carbon (BC) increased from 9.4 to 13.1 μg m−3. SO2 concentrations were relatively high in Stage I but nearly depleted in Stage II, indicating rapid oxidation of emitted SO2 to sulfate.

Figure 2 shows that the sulfate particles measured by high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-AMS) shifted to larger sizes during Stage II while the organic particles did not, consistent with sulfate formation taking place in fog and low cloud (cloud-mediated coagulation would have affected both sulfate and organic particles). Mean PM2.5 increased from 210 μg m−3 in Stage I to 330 μg m−3 in Stage II, while sulfate measured by HR-AMS increased fourfold from 10 to 40 μg m−3. The sampling efficiency of the HR-AMS instrument (PM1) drops off rapidly for particles above 1-μm diameter30, implying that actual sulfate levels during Stage II were probably much higher than measured. Indeed, PM2.5 sulfate concentrations measured at the site by on-line ion chromatography (URG-9000D Ambient Ion Monitor) were 1.5-2 times larger than the HR-AMS measurements during Stage II (Supplementary Fig. 3). Some of the sulfate particles could even be larger than PM2.5 due to swelling at high RH.

Fig. 2: Size distributions of organic and sulfate particles.

The Figure shows mass-based size distributions of (a) organic and (b) sulfate particles in Stages I and II of the December 16–22, 2016 haze event. M denotes mass and Dva denotes particle vacuum aerodynamic diameter. The measurements were made by the HR-AMS instrument with 50% size cut at 1-μm diameter, hence the data are shown as PM1 (particulate matter with less than 1-μm diameter). Mass modal diameters are shown as dotted lines.

Evidence for SO2 oxidation by HONO

A remarkable feature of the observations in Stage II is the large rise in N2O concentrations concurrently with sulfate. N2O is a major greenhouse gas with a globally dominant biogenic source31. It is chemically inert in the troposphere. Vehicles and coal combustion may be a significant source of N2O in Beijing32, but this would not explain the N2O rise in Stage II because no parallel rise was observed for BC (Fig. 1).

Figure 3 shows the relationships between the concentrations of sulfate and different nitrogen oxide species (N2O, HONO, NO2, and PM1 nitrate) observed in Stages I and II. The relationships are shown only for nighttime hours (19:00–06:00) to minimize strong common dependences on diurnal changes in mixed layer depth, and to avoid the effect of fast HONO photolysis in the daytime. Sulfate correlates positively with all species in Stage I, which may reflect common dependences on atmospheric mixing and ventilation. In Stage II, sulfate is positively correlated with N2O (including a step increase) and with HONO, but negatively correlated with NO2 and nitrate. This suggests a change in the regime for sulfate production in Stage II with associated production of N2O. Looking back at the tail end of the previous haze event on December 4, which also featured high-RH conditions, we again see elevated N2O together with sulfate (Fig. 1).

Fig. 3: Relationships between sulfate and nitrogen oxide concentrations.

Data are shown for Stages I and II of the December 16–22, 2016 haze event. Concentrations of sulfate and nitrogen oxides are expressed in common parts per billion (ppb) units (1 μg m−3 sulfate = 0.23 ppb at T = 273.15 K). Individual points are hourly mean values from Fig. 1 during nighttime hours (19:00–6:00 local time). The figure shows scatterplots of PM1 sulfate versus a nitrous oxide (N2O); b nitrous acid (HONO); c nitrogen dioxide (NO2); d PM1 nitrate. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and reduced-major-axis regression lines are shown separately for Stages I and II.

N2O is a product of the aqueous-phase oxidation of SO2 by HONO28,29. HONO is moderately soluble in water (Henry’s law constant KH = 49 M atm−1 at 298 K) and dissociates as a weak acid (pKa = 3.2 at 298 K) to increase its partitioning in the aqueous phase33. The aqueous-phase oxidation of SO2 by HONO can be expressed stoichiometrically as follows28,29:

$${\mathrm{2N(III)}} + {\mathrm{2S(IV)}} \to {\mathrm{N}}_2{\mathrm{O}} \uparrow + {\mathrm{2S(VI)}} + {\mathrm{other}}\,{\mathrm{products}}.$$	(R1)

Here N(III) ≡ HONO(aq) + NO2− denotes the dissolved HONO species, S(IV) ≡ SO2∙H2O + HSO3− + SO32− denotes the dissolved SO2 species, and S(VI) ≡ H2SO4(aq) + HSO4− + SO42− denotes the sulfate species. The other products may include H2O or H+ depending on the speciation of N(III), S(IV), and S(VI). A laboratory study by Martin et al.28 gives a rate expression for sulfate formation from reaction (R1) at pH < 4:

$$d\left[ {{\mathrm{S}}\left( {{\mathrm{VI}}} \right)} \right]/dt = k_1\left[ {{\mathrm{H}}^ + } \right]^{0.5}\left[ {{\mathrm{N}}\left( {{\mathrm{III}}} \right)} \right]{\mathrm{[S(IV)]}},$$	(1)

where k1 = 142 M−3/2 s−1. Another study by Oblath et al.27 gives a rate expression

$$d\left[ {{\mathrm{S}}\left( {{\mathrm{VI}}} \right)} \right]/dt = k_1^\prime \left[ {{\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{ + }}} \right]\left[ {{\mathrm{N}}\left( {{\mathrm{III}}} \right)} \right]{\mathrm{[S}}\left( {{\mathrm{IV}}} \right],$$	(2)

with k'1 = 4800 M−2 s−1 for 3 < pH < 7. Even though these rate expressions show positive [H+] dependences, the rates actually increase with pH because both [S(IV)] and [N(III)] are inversely dependent on [H+] over the relevant pH range.

The increase of N2O in Stage II concomitant with sulfate suggests that reaction (R1) could be a source of sulfate. However, the slopes of the sulfate-N2O regression lines in Fig. 3 are similar for Stages I and II and not consistent with the 2:1 stoichiometry of reaction (R1). A possible explanation is that the PM1 sulfate measurements underestimated total sulfate concentrations during Stage II, as shown above. In addition, it is likely that the correlations and slopes are mainly driven by mixing rather than chemistry, as is frequently observed in polluted air masses34,35. The signature of the reaction (R1) taking place in Stage II would then be manifested by the step increase in N2O between the two Stages.
