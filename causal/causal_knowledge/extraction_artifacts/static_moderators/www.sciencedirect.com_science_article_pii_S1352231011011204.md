Abstract
In January and February 2011, PM2.5 concentrations in residential and nonresidential areas of Salt Lake City, Utah, were elevated during days with persistent multi-day stable layers or cold-air pools (CAPs). Under most conditions the PM2.5 concentrations and atmospheric stability increased with time during these events, so that the highest PM2.5 concentrations were observed in long-lived CAPs. PM2.5 concentrations were generally observed to decrease with increasing elevation and were linearly related to the pre-sunrise valley heat deficit, an instantaneous measure of atmospheric stability. Decreases of up to 30 percent were observed as elevation increased from 1300 to 1600 m. During the CAP episode of 23–30 January, concentrations of PM2.5 increased roughly linearly with time at all elevations at the rate of about 6 μg (m3 day)−1. Higher elevation sites also experienced more rapid influxes of clean air during the mix-out of a CAP on 16 January, although short-lived episodes of higher concentrations occurred at times when polluted air was carried upslope from the residual CAP that persisted at lower elevations.
Highlights
► Series of persistent cold-air pools (CAP) formed in Salt Lake Valley 1 Jan - 20 Feb 2011. ► PM2.5 concentrations increased with time and CAP strength. ► Within CAPs, ground-level PM2.5 concentrations decreased with altitude. ► During 23–30 Jan CAP, rate of increase in PM2.5 concentration was linear at 6 μg (m3 day)−1. ► Breakup of CAP on 16 Jan 2011 occurred first at higher elevations.
Introduction
Winters in the Salt Lake Valley and other nearby valleys are punctuated by persistent cold-air pools (CAPs) or multi-day episodes of high ambient atmospheric stability that are accompanied by high levels of particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5). These polluted, high-stability episodes are referred to locally as the Salt Lake Valley ‘inversion’. Concentrations of PM2.5 can reach 100 μg m−3, exceeding the 24-h average National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 35 μg m−3 (U.S. EPA, 2011). In 2009, the U.S. EPA declared three regions in northern Utah nonattainment areas for 24-h average PM2.5 (Utah Division of Air Quality, 2011a). A study conducted by the State of Utah and other organizations (Utah Asthma Program et al., 2010) showed that the odds of emergency department visits in Salt Lake County, with a primary diagnosis of asthma, are 42% higher during days 5–7 of prolonged inversions than for non-inversion periods.
Persistent multi-day CAPs in Salt Lake County and along the Wasatch Front are common in the winter months of November through February (Holzworth, 1962, Holzworth and Fisher, 1979, Wolyn and McKee, 1989, Reeves and Stensrud, 2009). Because vertical mixing of pollutants is suppressed in the stable atmospheric layers, PM2.5 aerosols emitted into the CAP or produced there through chemical and photochemical processes lead to high levels of PM2.5. The conditions that determine the frequency and duration of the CAPs and their associated PM2.5 concentrations are high-pressure weather systems and the large solar zenith angles of winter that reduce insolation and, thus, surface heating (Savoie and McKee, 1995, Whiteman et al., 2001). Under a high-pressure weather system, the subsiding warm air traps cold air in the Wasatch Front’s mountain valleys. The pool of cold air is reinforced by radiational cooling during clear nights and by snow-cover and cloudiness that reduce daytime warming of the ground by reflecting much of the incoming solar radiation back to space.
The depths of wintertime surface-based stable layers tend to increase with time during a CAP episode. These surface-based stable layers, which are sometimes associated with additional elevated stable layers, often reach 500 m above the valley floor to elevations of 1800 m above mean sea level (MSL). Residential areas in Salt Lake County extend to about 1600 m MSL and are thus often within the typical stable layers.
The effects of surface-based stable layers on PM2.5 concentrations are well documented and are not limited to mountain valleys. During the winter months in Steubenville, OH, for example, one-hour average ambient PM2.5 showed peak concentrations of 140 μg m−3 during nighttime, surface-based temperature inversions. The following afternoon concentrations were dramatically lower (Connell et al., 2005). Similarly, levels of PM2.5 in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada increased by 54% during nighttime inversions (Wallace and Kanaroglou, 2009).
Dramatic effects of stable conditions have been observed in Fairbanks, Alaska (Tran and Mölders, 2011). A review of 10 years of data (1999–2009) for Nov–Feb showed that the NAAQS for PM2.5, 35 μg m−3, were exceeded under calm, low temperature, low humidity, multi-day surface inversion conditions. Low temperatures (≤ −20 °C) were a significant contributing factor because of increased emissions from domestic heating and electric power production during cold periods. During multi-day events at temperatures above −20 °C, high humidity (>75%) acted to lower PM2.5. This occurred because of water adsorption by particles, swelling, coagulation, and increased sedimentation rates. Ice fog had no impact on PM2.5 concentrations.
A study conducted in the Cache Valley, Utah, 145 km north of Salt Lake City, examined the meteorological, geographical, and environmental causes of high concentrations of PM2.5 during January 2004 (Malek et al., 2006). One persistent CAP event led to a 24-h PM2.5 concentration of 133 μg m−3 on 15 January 2004. The meteorological conditions responsible for these episodes included the lack of precipitation and winds, snow-covered ground that reflected incident solar radiation, and stable atmospheric conditions enhanced by prolonged high surface pressures. Similar conditions are common in the nearby Salt Lake Valley.
A study of the Salt Lake Valley compared one-hour average PM2.5 concentration measurements from TEOM (Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance) and RAMS (Real-time total Ambient Mass Sampler) analyzers (Longa et al., 2003). Data from the breakup of a January 2000 temperature inversion were particularly striking with PM2.5 abruptly dropping from 100 to 10 μg m−3. The authors attribute evening and morning peaks in PM2.5 during temperature inversions to automobile emissions from the evening and morning commutes. The RAMS was designed to include and retain semi-volatile species such as ammonium nitrate and organic compounds. The TEOM PM2.5 readings were about 30% lower than those from the RAMS.
While the ‘inversions’ are well known to residents of the Salt Lake Valley, little information is available in the scientific literature on how concentrations of PM2.5 change with time and elevation during wintertime along the Wasatch Front. The primary objective of this study is to measure PM2.5 in residential and non-residential areas of Salt Lake City at altitudes ranging from 1300 to 1800 m and to determine the characteristics of PM2.5 as the wintertime atmosphere evolves and CAPs form and dissipate. Most of the results were obtained with portable samplers with a sampling period of 24 h. Supplementary results came from 5-min-average measurements made at two locations.

Materials and methods
Table 1 lists the sites and site characteristics for the aerosol sampling and meteorological equipment used in this paper. A map of the sites is given in Fig. 1, and further information on the four different types of aerosol samplers used in the study (TEOM, Grimm, Partisol and MiniVol) is given in Table 2. The samplers were deployed on a line that ascended monotonically from south to north through and above the Avenues residential district on the north side of the Salt Lake Valley from 1306 m
Temporal variation of PM2.5 concentrations
PM2.5 concentrations were quite variable in the Salt Lake Valley during the 1 January through 20 February period of data collection, as meteorological conditions changed and persistent cold-air pools came and went (Fig. 2). Fig. 2a shows how the valley atmosphere’s heat deficit, a measure of CAP strength, changed with time during the experimental period. The valley heat deficit (Whiteman et al., 1999) is calculated from

Conclusions
Analysis of PM2.5 concentration data from several types of near-surface samplers during a 1 January through 20 February 2011 period in which a sequence of persistent cold-air pools formed in the Salt Lake Valley led to the following conclusions:
•PM2.5 concentrations increase with valley heat deficit, a measure of CAP strength.
•The valley heat deficit and PM2.5 concentrations increase with time during multi-day CAPs. Higher concentrations are thus generally found in the longest lasting CAPs.

Impacts of snow and cloud covers on satellite-derived PM2.5 levels

Citation Excerpt :

In some mountainous areas of Upstate New York, 1–2 μg/m3 higher PM2.5 accumulated in valleys in winter was observed. This phenomenon is consistent with the findings of previous studies suggesting that the stagnant weather conditions in valleys caused by strong temperature inversions could lead to the increase in PM2.5 levels (Gillies et al., 2010; Silcox et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012). This study considered snow cover in AOD gap-filling process by introducing the snow fraction in the gap-filling model.

Persistent inversion dynamics and wintertime PM10 air pollution in Alpine valleys
2016, Atmospheric Environment
Citation Excerpt :

In the last few years, a growing concern about persistent inversions in deep valleys emerged, which led to several field campaigns: the Persistent Cold-Air Pool Study (PCAPS, Lareau et al., 2013), in the Salt Lake Valley in Utah, the COLd-air Pooling EXperiment (COLPEX, Price et al., 2011) which studied inversions in a region of small hills in the U.K., or very recently the Passy-2015 field campaign (Paci et al., 2015; Staquet et al., 2015) in the Chamonix-Mont-Blanc Valley in France. During PCAPS, a clear relationship was found between concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and the atmospheric stability inferred from a bulk measure of the valley heat deficit (Silcox et al., 2012). Whiteman et al. (2014) extended this analysis by using radiosondes and air quality data over 40 years, and showed that in such deep valleys in winter, PM2.5 concentrations are closely related to the integrated atmospheric stability, suggesting that strong wintertime pollution is to be related to multiday inversions.
