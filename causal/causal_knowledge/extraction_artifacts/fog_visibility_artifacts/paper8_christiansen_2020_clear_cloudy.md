## Key Findings

### 1. Clear-Sky vs Cloudy PM2.5 Concentrations
In all regions, clear-sky PM2.5 concentrations are generally higher than cloudy with some exceptions during winter. This is a counter-intuitive finding that supports the edge case of "clear sky high PM2.5".

### 2. Chemical Composition Differences
Cloudy and clear-sky periods exhibit significant differences in PM2.5 mass and chemical composition that vary regionally and seasonally.

### 3. Aerosol Liquid Water (ALW) Differences
In the eastern US, relative humidity alone cannot explain differences in ALW, suggesting that emissions and in situ chemistry related to anthropogenic sources exert determining impacts.

### 4. Cloud Processing Effects
Cloud processing alters physical and chemical parameters of boundary layer aerosol:
- Changes aerosol size distribution
- Alters hygroscopicity
- Modifies oxygen to carbon (O:C) ratio

## Relevance to Edge Cases
This paper is highly relevant to the edge case of "clear sky high PM2.5":
1. Provides evidence that clear-sky PM2.5 can be higher than cloudy conditions
2. Explains that photochemistry and emissions drive this pattern
3. Shows regional and seasonal variation in this relationship

## Relationships to Extract
1. **clear_sky → photochemical_reaction → soa_formation → pm25** (INDIRECT_CAUSE)
   - Mechanism: Enhanced photochemistry under clear sky conditions promotes SOA formation
   - Conditions: Clear sky, high solar radiation
   - Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH
