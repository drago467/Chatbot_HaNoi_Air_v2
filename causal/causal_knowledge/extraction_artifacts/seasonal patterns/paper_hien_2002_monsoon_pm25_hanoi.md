## Key Findings

### Monsoon System in Hanoi

Hanoi is influenced by the Southeast Asia monsoon regime with two distinct monsoon seasons:

**Northeast monsoon (Winter)**: October to March - characterized by air masses from Siberia High and East China Sea. This period has the highest PM2.5 concentrations.

**Southeast monsoon (Summer)**: May to September - characterized by moist air from the Pacific. This period has much lower particulate pollution.

### Seasonal PM2.5 Patterns

The paper documents dramatic seasonal variation in PM concentrations:

**Winter (October-March)**: PM10 can exceed 300 μg/m³, PM2.5 frequently exceeds 50 μg/m³. Most pollution episodes occur during this period.

**Summer (June-August)**: PM10 can be as low as 10 μg/m³.

**Annual means**: PM10 = 87.1 ± 3.1 μg/m³, PM2.5 = 36.1 ± 1.3 μg/m³

### Key Mechanisms Identified

#### 1. Nocturnal Radiation Inversions (NRIs)
- Occur from October to December
- Cause very high PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 concentrations
- PM2.5-10 fraction is much enhanced
- Pollution significantly higher at night than daytime
- Associated with dry air from inland China trajectories

#### 2. Subsidence Temperature Inversions (STIs)
- Occur from January to March
- Cause high PM concentrations
- Particulate mass evenly distributed between fine and coarse fractions
- No significant diurnal variations during STI events
- Associated with moist air from Pacific Ocean trajectories

### Multiple Regression Analysis Results

The paper identified key meteorological determinants of PM2.5:

**Primary determinants of PM2.5**:
- Wind speed (most important)
- Air temperature

**Primary determinants of PM2.5-10**:
- Rainfall
- Relative humidity
(indicating high abundance of soil dust in coarse fraction)

**Turbulence parameters**:
- Vertical gradients of potential temperature (at 06:30)
- Vertical gradients of wind speed (at 18:30)

**Explanatory power**: Meteorological parameters could explain 60-74% of day-to-day variations in particulate concentrations.

### Air Mass Trajectories

**First winter period (Oct-Dec)**: Continental air masses from Siberia High travel through inland China, supplying dry air and facilitating nocturnal radiation inversions.

**Second winter period (Jan-Mar)**: Cold air parcels mostly travel through Pacific Ocean via Gulf of Tonkin, supplying moist air and creating subsidence temperature inversions under anticyclonic conditions.

## Quantitative Data

- PM10 US NAAQS (150 μg/m³) exceeded on 52 days per year
- PM2.5 exceeded 50 μg/m³ on 77 days per year
- Most exceedances from October 1998 to February 1999

## Relevant Quotes for Extraction

1. "Very high PM2.5 and PM2.5−10 concentrations were observed in conjunction with the occurrence of nocturnal radiation inversions from October to December and subsidence temperature inversions (STI) from January to March."

2. "In summer (May–September) particulate pollution was much lower than in winter."

3. "The most important determinants of PM2.5 are wind speed and air temperature."

4. "Meteorological parameters could explain from 60% to 74% of the day-to-day variations of particulate concentrations."
