Rapid reappearance of air pollution after cold air outbreaks in northern and eastern China
Qian Liu, Guixing Chen, Lifang Sheng, and Toshiki Iwasaki
Abstract

The cold air outbreak (CAO) is the most important way to reduce air pollution during the winter over northern and eastern China. However, a rapid reappearance of air pollution is usually observed during its decay phase. Is there any relationship between the reappearance of air pollution and the properties of CAO? To address this issue, we investigated the possible connection between air pollution reappearance and CAO by quantifying the properties of the residual cold air mass after CAO. Based on the analyses of recent winters (2014–2022), we found that the rapid reappearance of air pollution in the CAO decay phase has an occurrence frequency of 63 %, and the air quality in more than 50 % of CAOs worsens compared to that before CAO. The reappearance of air pollution tends to occur in the residual cold air mass with a weak horizontal flux during the first 2 d after CAO. By categorizing the CAOs into groups of rapid and slow air pollution reappearance, we found that the residual cold air mass with a moderate depth of 150–180 hPa, a large negative heat content, and small slopes of isentropes is favorable for the rapid reappearance of air pollution. Among these factors, the cold air mass depth is highly consistent with the mixing layer height, below which most air pollutants are found; the negative heat content and slope of isentropes in the cold air mass jointly determine the intensity of low-level vertical stability. The rapid reappearance of air pollution is also attributed to the maintenance of the residual cold air mass and the above conditions, which are mainly regulated by the dynamic transport process rather than diabatic cooling or heating. Furthermore, analysis of the large-scale circulation of CAOs in their initial stage shows that the anticyclonic (cyclonic) pattern in northern Siberia (northeastern Asia) can be recognized as a precursor for the rapid (slow) reappearance of air pollution after the CAO.

1 Introduction

Air pollution is one of the main meteorological disasters in China during the boreal winter, threatening public health, the environment, and economic activities (Guan et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2013; Tie et al., 2016). Northern and eastern China (NEC) experiences the most pollution, which mainly is haze pollution, resulting in attention from researchers. Statistics show that air pollution or haze events in NEC have had an occurrence frequency of approximately 20–40 d during the winters since 2010 (Ding and Liu, 2014; Chen and Wang, 2015; Yang et al., 2016; Dang and Liao, 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). In some cities, such as Beijing, the occurrence frequency approaches 60 d (Li et al., 2021). Moreover, severe air pollution has also occurred frequently over NEC in recent years, during which the air quality index usually exceeds the upper limit. In some widely reported air pollution events during January 2013, December 2015, and December 2016, the regional daily mean PM2.5 concentration exceeds 500 µg m−3 (Zhang et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2016; Yin and Wang, 2017). Even when local emission was obviously reduced during COVID-19 lockdown, severe air pollution still occurs in northern China (Zhao et al., 2020). Faced with the demands of improving air quality, progress in understanding the variations in air pollution is of great importance.

The formation of air pollution in NEC can be attributed to heavy emissions, topography, and unfavorable meteorological conditions (Zhang et al., 2013; Cao et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016; Dang and Liao, 2019; An et al., 2019). The recent COVID-19 lockdowns also provide a unique opportunity to study the complex chemical effects of air pollution and meteorology (Le et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). As emissions and topography do not vary much from day to day, meteorological conditions play an important role in impacting variations in air pollution on the synoptic timescale (Kang et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). Previous studies showed that weak surface winds, high relative humidity, enhanced temperature inversion, low atmospheric boundary layer height, and less precipitation facilitate the accumulation and maintenance of air pollutants (Ding and Liu, 2014; Wang and Chen, 2016; Li et al., 2017). These unfavorable meteorological conditions usually occur in stagnant weather controlled by high-pressure systems or anomalous anticyclonic patterns (Yang et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2019; An et al., 2020).

Cold air outbreaks (CAOs) are generally considered to be conducive to the removal of air pollution in NEC (Qu et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021). However, our recent study shows that air pollutant concentrations sometimes experienced a rapid increase after CAO, forming a new round of air pollution with even higher pollutant concentrations than the period before CAO (Liu et al., 2019). During the reappearance of air pollution, the regional mean pollutant concentrations increased by as much as 2.8 times compared to concentrations reduced by CAO. Some studies also provide clues for the reappearance of air pollution after CAO. Under high-emission conditions, the removal of air pollution caused by strong surface winds is usually maintained for only approximately 1 d and then rapidly returns to the polluted state (Liu et al., 2016). Wang et al. (2014) shows that, during persistent heavy air pollution in January 2013, cold air activity could only temporarily reduce the air pollutant concentration. The reappearance of air pollution is usually characterized by explosive growth, with air pollutant concentrations increasing from a few to tens and even hundreds of micrograms per cubic meter within 1 d (Sun et al., 2016). These results suggest that a considerable portion of air pollution in NEC can be linked to the decay of the CAO. Many previous studies have noted the reappearance of air pollution after CAO, while few studies have made statistics on the reappeared air pollution. So far, the quantitative relationship and relevant physical mechanisms between air pollution reappearance and CAO properties are still unclear. To explore the mechanisms modulating rapid increases in air pollutants, further analysis showing the detailed features and structures of CAOs, especially during their decay stages, is required. Additionally, since CAOs are easy to identify and predict in their initial stages, they also have potential as precursory signals for the burst of severe air pollution.

In this study, a quantitative measurement of the cold air mass (Iwasaki et al., 2014) is adopted to identify CAO and its dynamic/thermodynamic characteristics. Based on the analyses of CAOs and accompanying variations in air pollution during recent winters, our study will verify the generic existence of air pollution reappearance after CAO. Then, we will clarify the CAO with characteristics, such as depth, horizontal flux, coldness, and large-scale circulation patterns of the cold air mass, that may result in the rapid reappearance of air pollution. The rest of this study is organized as follows. The data and methods used in this study are described in Sect. 2. Statistical features of air pollution reappearance, and its association with CAO evolution, are examined in Sect. 3. The key features of CAO affecting the air pollution reappearance and the involved physical mechanisms are discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 further investigates the large-scale circulation pattern of the CAO. A short summary is presented in Sect. 6.

2 Data and methods
2.1 Data

To identify the CAO events, we used isobaric analysis data of the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55). This dataset is freely available from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA; http://search.diasjp.net/en/dataset/JRA55, last access: 14 October 2022) and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR; https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds628.0/, last access: 14 October 2022). The JRA-55 has a horizontal resolution of 1.25∘ with 37 vertical pressure levels and a time interval of 6 h (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 UTC). Previous studies have shown that JRA-55 has good performance in identifying and describing CAOs over East Asia (Yamaguchi et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020, 2021).

The variation in air pollutant concentration in this study is described using the air quality index (AQI) from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China. The AQI quantifies overall air quality based on the primary air pollutant in the monitored area, with observations of 1 h frequency. Data from 475 stations (in 98 cities) across NEC (30–40∘ N, 114–122∘ E), covering the winters (November to March) from 2014/2015 to 2021/2022, were used. The determination of the study area (NEC), including parts of both northern China and eastern China, is based on the characteristics of both air pollution and cold air activity. The air pollution (AQI >100) mainly occurs between the latitudes of 30 and 40∘ N, and the CAOs also usually affect areas around 30∘ N (figure omitted). The AQI stations in the study area have a relatively even distribution (figure omitted). The stations are located not only in urban areas but also suburban and rural areas. It should be noted that the daily mean values of AQI and another well-known air pollution index of PM2.5 concentration (primary air pollutant of haze) has a high correlation coefficient of 0.96 in the study period. The key results of this study are in a good agreement with results based on PM2.5 concentration (figure omitted).

The sounding data obtained from the University of Wyoming provides a direct detection of the atmospheric vertical profile, which would help to explain the changes in AQI observation. The following four sounding stations were selected in NEC: Beijing (39.8∘ N, 116.5∘ E), Zhangqiu (36.7∘ N, 117.6∘ E), Nanjing (31.9∘ N, 118.9∘ E), and Baoshan (31.4∘ N, 121.5∘ E). Observation times were 00:00 and 12:00 UTC (08:00 and 20:00 LT). The vertical resolution of the sounding data is comparable to that of JRA-55 model grid reanalysis data. For example, sounding data at Beijing station have 60–70 levels in total and 8–14 levels below 850 hPa during a CAO event on 14–17 December 2016. The data sources of all variables used in this study are listed in Table 1.

2.2 Isentropic analysis of the cold air outbreak

The identification and quantification of the cold air mass and its outbreaks are performed by an isentropic analysis method. The cold air mass is defined as a layer of air mass below the threshold isentropic surface of θT=280 K, which includes most of the equatorward cold air mass flow (Iwasaki et al., 2014). Thus, the depth of the cold air mass (DP; hPa) can be described as the pressure difference between the ground surface (ps) and the θT surface (p(θT)) as follows:

The horizontal flux of the cold air mass (F, hPa m s−1) is given by the vertical integration of the horizontal wind (v) and the pressure (p), as follows:

The negative heat content (NHC; K hPa), reflecting the coldness of the cold air mass, is defined as a vertical integration of the potential temperature difference (θT−θ) and pressure (p), as follows:

Based on the above method, the CAO can be identified by the regional mean cold air mass depth. Previous studies showed that the cold air mass depth usually experiences a sharp increase and reaches a relatively high value during the outbreak (Shoji et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2019, 2021). Thus, the CAO in this study is identified when the regional mean cold air mass depth exceeds 166.8 hPa, which is the sum of mean value (77.3 hPa) and standard deviation (89.5 hPa) of the cold air mass depth on all winter days.According to the above criteria, 52 CAOs are identified over eight winters.

The CAO is further divided into three periods. Figure 1 shows the temporal evolution of the cold air mass depth in NEC during a typical CAO in March 2016. The onset of a CAO event, which is the first day when the regional mean cold air mass depth exceeds the threshold (166.8 hPa), is described as day 0. The “during” period of the CAO starts on the onset day (day 0) to the end on the day when the cold air mass depth falls below the threshold (e.g., day +2 in the CAO event plotted in Fig. 1). The period before CAO is defined as the 2 d before the onset day to the onset day (days −2 to 0). The period after CAO, which is also called the decay phase, is defined as the 3 d after the cold air mass depth falls below the threshold (days +2 to +4 in the CAO event plotted in Fig. 1). The period after CAO varies with events, since the end date of the period during the CAO is different in the selected events. It should be noted that the cold air mass in the period after CAO is described as the residual cold air mass in this study.

2.3 Measurement of air pollution reappearance and mixing layer height

The description of air pollution reappearance is based on the AQI in different periods of the CAO, as shown in Fig. 1. In the period before CAO, the AQI decreases from a polluted state to a relatively clean state. The AQI usually reaches its minimum in the period during CAO. Then, the AQI increases and results in a new round of air pollution in the period after CAO. Thus, we use the maximum AQI in the period before CAO (AQI_b) and the maximum AQI in the period after CAO (AQI_a) to represent the air pollution before CAO and the reappeared air pollution, respectively. The minimum AQI in the period during CAO (AQI_d) is used to represent the clean state between the air pollution before and after the CAO.

Based on the above analysis, the increase in AQI (IA) is defined as follows to describe the deterioration rate of air pollution in its reappearance:

A rapid reappearance of air pollution is supposed to have an IA larger than 34.3, which is the standard deviation of the AQI daily variation during the five winters. A reappearance index of air pollution (RI) is also defined below to describe the relative intensity of reappeared air pollution compared to the air pollution before CAO,

where RI larger (smaller) than 1 denotes that the AQI after CAO is worse (better) than that before CAO.

The mixing layer height is determined from the analysis of the profile of the bulk Richardson number (RB) using sounding data. The calculation method for RB is derived from Tang et al. (2016) as follows:
