## Key Findings

### Quantitative PM2.5 Impact

**Peak PM2.5 concentration**: 383.9 µg/m³ during firework activities around 00:00 local time (New Year midnight).

**Enrichment factor**: Total water-soluble bulk particle mass concentrations were enriched by **5.7 times** during fireworks relative to background.

**Water-soluble mass fraction**: PM2.5 water-soluble mass fraction increased by **18.5%** above background values.

### Mechanisms of Firework Impact

The paper identifies several key mechanisms:

1. **Direct emission**: Fireworks emit particles primarily in the submicrometer range through combustion of fuels (metals, alloys), oxidizers (nitrates, perchlorates), and coloring agents (metal salts).

2. **Vertical distribution**: High-spectral-resolution lidar recorded substantial increase in backscattered signal with high aerosol loading ~440 m above the surface during peak firework activities.

3. **Chemical composition changes**: Potassium and non-sea-salt SO4²⁻ contributed 70.9% to water-soluble mass. Mass size distributions shifted from smaller to larger submicrometer mode during fireworks.

4. **Hygroscopicity changes**: Bulk particle hygroscopicity (kappa) increased from 0.11 (background) to 0.18 (fireworks) due to increased inorganic volume fractions.

### Tracer Species for Fireworks

Best firework tracer species identified: Cu, Ba, Sr, K+, Al, and Pb
- These exhibited highest enrichments (6.1 to 65.2 times) during fireworks
- Potassium historically most observable tracer

### Health and Environmental Effects

The paper notes fireworks cause:
- Visibility reduction
- Increased health risks (asthma, eye allergies, cardiovascular/pulmonary issues)
- Short-term exposure effects: cough, fever
- Long-term exposure: 2% increase in health effects based on non-carcinogenic hazard index

### Temporal Dynamics

- Steep increases in nucleation-mode and Aitken-mode particle concentrations during fireworks
- Elevated accumulation-mode particle concentrations maintained for up to 3 hours after peak activity
- Particle residence time: several days to weeks for submicrometer particles

### Regional Context

This is the first comprehensive physicochemical and optical measurement of fireworks in a Southeast Asia megacity. Fireworks are a regular part of the culture in SEA, making this highly relevant for Vietnam/Hanoi during Tet celebrations.
