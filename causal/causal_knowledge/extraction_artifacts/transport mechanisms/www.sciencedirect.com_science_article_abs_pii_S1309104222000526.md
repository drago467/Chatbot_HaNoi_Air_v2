Abstract
Local and regional sources contribute to degraded air quality in many urban areas, however, the influence of trans-boundary air pollution on surface PM2.5 is still poorly characterized in Southeast Asia (SEA) megacities. This study, for the first time, utilizes multi-platform datasets to elucidate two trans-boundary PM2.5 episodes in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam, over the periods 25–29 Oct 2013 and 05–08 Oct 2015. Both events persisted with limited diurnal fluctuations and more than 60% of the Air Quality Index (AQI) values at an unhealthy level. PM2.5 concentrations during the events were 100% and 115% higher on average compared to local accumulation periods in the same months, highlighting the importance of trans-boundary pollution to local HCMC air quality. Backward trajectories, MERRA-2 AOD data, and CALIPSO images revealed the origin and synoptic meteorology conditions facilitating both trans-boundary pollution events. Anthropogenic PM2.5 emissions in continental East Asia fed the 2013 event, which was then transported by strong northeasterly winds triggered by an upper-level ridge near the Tibetan Plateau and a low-pressure system in western Pacific Ocean. In contrast, the 2015 event was the result of Indonesia biomass burning (BB), which was enhanced and transported by a westward propagating Western Pacific Subtropical High triggered by a strong El Niño event. Future climate change will likely increase the number of extreme El Niño events, leading to the increase of transboundary Indonesia BB events to HCMC. This study lays the groundwork for detailing the impact of trans-boundary pollution on local air quality in SEA megacities.

Introduction
Fine particulate matter (i.e. PM2.5, particles with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or lower than 2.5 μm in ambient air) have a large impact on human health — linked to several million deaths per year globally — and impact atmospheric visibility (Shih et al., 2021; Xulu et al., 2020) and the ecological environment (Cohen et al., 2017), thus is a critical factor for characterizing the severity of urban air pollution episodes (Hien et al., 2019; Maji et al., 2018; Shimada et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015; Zhang and Friedlander, 2000). Major anthropogenic sources of PM2.5 include vehicular emissions, industrial emissions (e.g. coal), and biomass burning, while secondary aerosol formation driven by reaction of precursor gases is a further important contribution route (Hien et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2021b; Wang et al., 2015). Moreover, regional transport of PM2.5 can cause significant air quality impacts in a receptor region and the incoming plume might entirely dominate the total particle concentration (Chen et al., 2019; Chuang et al., 2008; Griffith et al., 2020). For instance, Chen et al. (2019) reported that regional transport accounts for about 57% of the near-surface PM2.5 concentration in the Pearl River Delta, China. Furthermore, PM2.5 contains hundreds to thousands of different compounds, some of which are highly toxic with long lifetimes (days to weeks) and capable of surviving the long-range transport (LRT) to downwind receptor regions (Kaneyasu et al., 2014; Griffith et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2021b; Sheu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2021). Therefore, fully understanding both local and regional contributions to PM2.5 pollution is crucial for effective local government air pollution control policies.
Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), home to about 10 million people in Southern Vietnam, has poor air quality that has rapidly worsened in the past two decades due to increased anthropogenic emissions (Phung et al., 2016; Hien et al., 2019). A recent study by Hien et al. (2019) analyzed the PM2.5 data at 5 sampling sites across urban HCMC from March 2017 to March 2018 showing an annual mean (±S.D.) of 36.3 ± 13.7 μg m−3, more than three times the WHO air quality guideline and that exceeded the Vietnamese annual standard by 45%. Traffic-related sources, anthropogenic activities, and local meteorological conditions (i.e. wind speed and rainfall amount) were considered as important driving factors of PM2.5 variability in HCMC (Hien et al., 2019). Traffic activities, especially motorbikes, are believed to be a major emission source of PM2.5 in HCMC, contributing about 3.34 Gg yr−1 to the total PM2.5 emission inventory (Duong et al., 2018; Hien et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2021c). Besides, industrial activity and construction also contribute about 0.25 Gg annually to the total local PM2.5 budget in HCMC (Hien et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2021c). Although past studies have focused on the local factors contributing to PM2.5 concentrations in HCMC, the impact of regional transport (i.e. transboundary pollution) on the city's air quality is still lacking.
HCMC is situated in the tropical region between maritime Southeast Asia and China, which are significant sources areas for biomass burning (BB) and anthropogenic pollution, respectively, in Asia. Intense BB in Indonesia in July–October causes serious air quality problems domestically, but also to regional countries, such as Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand (Permadi and Kim Oanh, 2013). In Indonesia, the annual burning of lowland forest and peat by farmers is part of the land-clearing activities (Engling et al., 2014; Field et al., 2016), but such fires can get out of control and spread to adjacent areas, resulting in large-scale air pollution commonly referred to as “haze” (Engling et al., 2014; Field et al., 2016). From 2001 to 2018, annual BB in equatorial SEA was primarily concentrated in Sumatra and Borneo, representing ∼70% of the total fire counts (Yin, 2020). Equatorial BB was also extremely sensitive to the strong 2014–2016 El Niño event, which caused a surge in the number of BB spots and fire radiative power (FRP) to 145,000 and 6.58 × 106 MW, respectively, 163.7% and 200.9% larger compared to other years from 2001 to 2018 (Yin, 2020). Particularly, the 2015 Indonesian fire season, in terms of pollution and fire activity, was the most devastating in the past 2 decades, and cost the country about $16 billion in losses due to destruction of crop fields, forestry, trade, industry, tourism, and other sectors (Field et al., 2016). In addition, the haze extending from this event also impacted air quality in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand (Field et al., 2016; Mead et al., 2018). Compared to Indonesia BB, anthropogenic emissions in China are intense year-round and have been studied in detail over the past decades (Li et al., 2017), with many studies treating the country as a source region for transboundary air pollution (Do et al., 2021; Kaneyasu et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2019a,b, Nguyen et al., 2019a, Nguyen et al., 2019b, Nguyen et al., 2020, Nguyen et al., 2021a, Nguyen et al., 2021b, Nguyen et al., 2021c, Nguyen et al., 2022; Sheu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2016). East Asian monsoon activity in winter drives much of the transboundary air pollution from China and significantly impacts downwind neighboring countries such as Japan (Jaffe et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2014; Marumoto et al., 2015), Taiwan (Do et al., 2021; Nguyen et al., 2019a, 2021a,b; Sheu et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2016), and Korea (Lee et al., 2013; Han et al., 2014). These studies, however, have been mostly concentrated in northeast Asia within the mid-latitudes, while corresponding studies of transboundary pollution from China to Southeast Asia (SEA), particularly to tropical areas, are still very limited.
Long-lasting high PM2.5 periods occurred in HCMC in Oct 2013 and Oct 2015 and seriously degraded the air quality and visibility for multiple days. These events did not exhibit the typical diurnal pattern of PM2.5 in HCMC, thus highlighting their non-local origins. Focusing on these two events, we identified the mechanisms responsible for these high PM2.5 level occurrences, including small- and large-scale meteorological conditions and connections to anthropogenic pollution in China and BB in Indonesia. We ultilized ground-based measurements in HCMC, satellite-based measurements and reanalysis data to determine the contribution of transboundary pollution from China and Indonesia on the air quality in HCMC during these events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the impact of trans-boundary PM2.5 pollution on surface air quality in peninsular SEA megacity. Our results provide important insights into the current PM2.5 pollution situation and its impact on the air quality in southern Vietnam, and improves our understanding of large-scale air pollution movement in Asia.

In-situ measurements
HCMC is a tropical city located in southern Vietnam, which lies between China and maritime Southeast Asia (Fig. 1). In-situ measurements were conducted at an air monitoring station established in 2013 within the campus of the University of Science, Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMUS; 10.763°N, 106.682°E; Fig. 1). This is a roadside station located 10 m away from Nguyen Van Cu Street, one of the busiest roads in urban HCMC. Hourly PM2.5 concentrations were continuously measured 
General characteristics and the influences of the events on October 2013 and 2015
Time series of the hourly PM2.5 mass concentrations and AQI values at HCMUS for Oct 2013 and Oct 2015 are shown in Fig. 2B,D. We have defined significant PM2.5 events at HCMUS as those with a 48-h PM2.5 concentration above the monthly mean concentration. Event periods were clearly observed from 25 to 29 Oct 2013 (109 h) and from 05 to 08 Oct 2015 (93 h). During the events, PM2.5 concentrations increased significantly, with hourly values continuously above the WHO 24-h mean criteria (25 μg m−3), 
Conclusion and implications
This study characterized, by utilizing multi-platform datasets, the transport mechanisms and impact of two types of trans-boundary pollution events that can influence HCMC, a megacity in tropical SEA. Significant impacts to the local PM2.5 and AQI levels in HCMC were observed over and above the local accumulation during the two events, which lay the foundation for evaluating the contribution of transboundary pollution to this and other critical megacities in SEA going forward.

Ancillary pollutants (e.g. CO, VOCs) were also observed to be induced in the early morning by increased anthropogenic activities in HCMC (Hien et al., 2022). Moreover, our previous study also showed concurrent PM10 and PBM10 (i.e. PM10-bound Hg) increases during early morning at HCMC (Nguyen et al., 2022a), suggesting the potential influence of Hg emission sources on TGM concentration at HCMC. Local emissions including vehicular activities and anthropogenic activities (e.g., coal combustion, industrial activities) increase significantly in the morning and thus could facilitate Hg emissions that drive up TGM concentrations during rush hours.
