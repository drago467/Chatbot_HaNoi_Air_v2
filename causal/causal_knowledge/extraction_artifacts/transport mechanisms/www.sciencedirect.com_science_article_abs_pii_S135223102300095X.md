Abstract
During the winter period (October to March), air quality in northern Vietnam is strongly impacted by the northeast monsoon cycles, that create periodic changes in the air masses pathways and the meteorological conditions. In this work, an original approach is proposed to identify the main sources contributing to the degradation of air quality in Hanoi and quantify the share of local and imported pollution under the influence of the northeast monsoon. Firstly, semi-climatic trends in particle emissions in East Asia and mainland Southeast Asia were studied using outputs from the NAAPS model, that assimilates space-borne Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) observations. From winter 2006/07 to winter 2010/11, the pollution plumes were most frequently located over the Indochina Peninsula, and the smoke partial AOD showed biomass burning activities (natural and anthropogenic) to be responsible. From winter 2011/12 to winter 2019/20 however, the pollution plumes were mostly observed over eastern China and to a lesser extent, Northern Vietnam, and the sulfate partial AOD indicated they came from coal-based industrial activities. Secondly, the impact of the northeast monsoon on the air masses origin was studied using HYSPLIT back-trajectories with clustering over the 14 winter periods. During regular winters, northeastern air masses predominated, which can bring pollution from eastern China and the industrial region surrounding Hanoi (Red River Delta). However, the existence of El Niño perturbed the air masses trajectories during three winters (2014/15, 2015/16 and 2018/19), bringing more western air masses and thus, causing a temporary decrease of the sulfate AOD and simultaneous increase of the smoke AOD over Hanoi. Thirdly, a method to classify the winter days and highlight the influence of cold surges on PM2.5 variability was built, relying only on Hanoi local wind and NAAPS AOD value. This classification allowed to estimate that long-range transport from China during the onset of cold surges caused an average increase of around 30% of the PM2.5 level in Hanoi. Additionally, the contribution of local pollution to the most severe pollution episodes, occurring during the persistence of cold surges, was estimated to be around 40% of the average PM2.5.

Introduction
Over the last decade, severe pollution episodes with high level of PM tended to be observed frequently over the Red River Delta (RRD) plain, Northern Vietnam, especially during the winter period (October to March) during which the Northeast monsoon is predominant. Due to rapid economic development, urbanization, and industrialization, the RRD has long been recognized as one of the most polluted regions in Vietnam (Bac and Hien, 2009; Le et al., 2020). In addition, most of the key industrial zones, along with most of the thermal power plants (TPPs) of Northern Vietnam are concentrated over the RRD region (Huy and Kim Oanh, 2017). The consumption of large amounts of coal and fossil fuels in these TPPs in order to meet the growing electricity demand over the last decade released an enormous amount of gaseous and particulates compounds. Industrial zones and TPPs are major sources of local pollution and regional transport, and are partly responsible for the degradation of air quality in the RRD. However, local pollution and regional transport may not be the only sources as the RRD area has been stated as a potential receptor for transboundary long-range transport (LRT) from East-Asia under the impact of the Northeast monsoon during the winter period. Concerning the daily variability in this period, an increase in air pollutant levels over the couple of days that follow a cold surge was observed in areas located downstream of China such as Taiwan, Malaysia and Northern Vietnam (Ashfold et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2014; Cohen et al., 2010a; Junker et al., 2009).
Within RRD area, Hanoi, Vietnam's capital has suffered bouts of repeated and continuous air pollution with high ambient levels of particulate matter in the last decades. The high levels of PM2.5 observed in Hanoi, in particular, often exceed the national ambient air quality standards (daily PM2.5 > 50 μg m−3) during the winter period. In fact, many studies on the air environment have been carried out with the aim of giving a picture of the current status of the air environment in Hanoi. Nevertheless, most of these studies were limited to a short-term period of investigation (from a month to a few months) and there was no analysis bearing on the whole winter period, nor on long-term variations of ambient pollutants' concentrations in Hanoi. For example, Nguyen et al. (2020) used the Weather Research and Forecasting/Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling (WRF/CMAQ) system to simulate the contribution of different sources to the total PM2.5 concentration in December 2010. Although, they reported that local and non-local sources accounted respectively for 57% and 43% during high pollution events, and 42% and 58% during lower pollution periods, this conclusion stood only for one month of the winter period. On the other hand, some studies have a longer study period but are based on older data from years when air pollution was not as explosive as it is nowadays. For instance, using Positive Matrix Factorization/PMF analysis, Hai and Kim Oanh. (2013) stated that the LRT was likely to represent a smaller part of the total PM2.5 (about 27%) compared to local pollution from December 2006 to February 2007. One of the longest studies conducted by Cohen et al. (2010a, 2010b), they reported the fingerprint source and contribution of fine particles (PM2.5) in Hanoi, however, these studies were based on measurement results from 2001 to 2008, which is a very long time compared to the current state of the air quality.
Thus, in order to evaluate the air pollution trend in Hanoi, it is imperative to obtain a detailed dataset, based on long-term and continuous observations and modeling of airborne pollutant trends and their variability. Besides, information is lacking about the inter-annual variations of air pollutants in Northern Vietnam, in relation with changes in the Northeast monsoon. This hinders the possibility to detect trends in specific emission sources, quantify the local and remote sources’ contributions, and fully understand the mechanisms of pollution events in Hanoi. To address the above-mentioned shortcomings, our goal in this study is to answer the following questions.
(i)
What are the main aerosol sources region in winter in East and South-East Asia and what are their trends over the 2006–2020 period?
(ii)
Which sources are actually susceptible to impact northern Vietnam through long-range transport, and what is the influence of the monsoon inter-annual variability on their contributions?
(iii)
What is the contribution rate of the various sources to the air pollution issue in Hanoi at daily scale?
In detail, as long time series of PM2.5 concentrations in Vietnam are lacking, AOD retrieved from U.S. Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) model is chosen as a proxy for PM2.5. 14-years database of AOD from 2006 to 2020 was built up in order to identify the pollution sources areas and their inter-annual evolution over East Asia and Southeast Asia, allowing question (i) to be addressed. In addition, a combination was made between long-term AOD database and backward trajectories conducted from the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model in order to analyze long-term AOD trends and the inter-annual variability of the Northeast monsoon under the influence of El-Niño events. From this, the potential emission sources impacting Hanoi from question (ii) will be assessed, with the goal to explore the adverse effects of meteorological conditions on air quality in Hanoi. At last, to solve the question (iii), we will finally propose a systematic procedure for identifying the impact of the cold intrusions on the air quality in Hanoi at a daily scale, by fully combining backward trajectories, NAAPS-AOD data, in-situ PM2.5 and weather observations.

Study area and in-situ observations
Hanoi is located on the plain of the RRD (Fig. 1 a - b) which is the most densely populated region of Northern Vietnam. Hanoi, during the winter, often annually receives 10 to 15 Northeast monsoons taking place from October to March of next year, not only directly affecting to the weather conditions of Hanoi but also causing the change in air quality. For investigating potential sources impacting air quality in Hanoi, pollution sources are classified into local pollution, regional transport and 
Spatial and temporal distribution of AOD in East Asia
Fig. 4 shows the spatial distribution of the 6-months averaged-total AOD retrieved from the NAAPS model during the winter period in EA and mainland SEA from winter period 2006/07 to period 2019/20. With the aim of investigating the characteristics of AOD sources for the studied area, not only the total AOD but also its components (sulfate, smoke and dust partial AOD) were further analyzed. The dust partial AOD distribution did not show any interesting feature over the study area, but the smoke
Discussion
This study is not the first to use AOD data to track air pollution changes over the RRD plain. The high values of AOD across the RRD plain confirmed in this investigation are in agreement with earlier studies (Bui et al., 2021; Luong et al., 2021). Our findings highlight the AOD increase may be associated with the growing number of coal-based TPPs over the RRD plain between 2011 and 2020. Besides, a relation between the change of AOD in Hanoi and semi-climatic oscillations during the winter was 
Summary
This study combined a long-term dataset of AOD from the NAAPS model with back-trajectory clustering using the HYSPLIT model. During the first 5 winters (2006/07 to 2010/11), the highest AOD values were observed over the Indochina Peninsula region, and this was mainly due to anthropogenic and natural biomass burning. For the rest of the studied period, the AOD map series indicated a very sharp increase in eastern China and northern Vietnam (the RRD plain) following the rapid economic development

From January to March, poor atmospheric dispersion conditions also occur, which are associated with anticyclone's subsidence temperature inversions in the near ground layer. More specifically, Phung et al. (2023) indicated that the stagnation of local air during the prolonged cold periods causes PM2.5 levels to increase by an average of about 40% in winter in Hanoi. It is known that the dominant sink for PM2.5 is generally removal by precipitation, as either rainout or washout (Anastasio and Martin, 2001).
