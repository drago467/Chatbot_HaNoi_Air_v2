## Key Findings

### Seasonal Variation of PM2.5
- **Winter PM2.5 concentration ~3 times higher than summer**
  - Summer (July 2020): 40.20 µg/m³ (average)
  - Winter (January 2021): 122.90 µg/m³ (average)
  
### Meteorological Factors (Table 1)
- **Wind speed**: Summer 1.31 times higher than winter
- **Boundary layer height**: Summer 1.26 times higher than winter
- **Temperature**: Summer 2.02 times higher than winter
- **Relative humidity**: Summer 1.06 times higher than winter

### Mechanisms Identified

#### 1. Unfavorable Meteorological Conditions in Winter
**Quote**: "The unfavorable meteorological conditions (lower wind speed and lower boundary layer height) in the winter period were identified as one of the key factors contributing to the high PM2.5 pollution in this period."

**Mechanism**: 
- Lower wind speed → Reduced dispersion
- Lower boundary layer height → Trapping of pollutants near surface
- "Moderate to strong negative correlations between wind speed and PM2.5"
- "Similar result was also seen when examining the effects of boundary layer height"

#### 2. Long-Range Transport in Winter
**Quote**: "With the predominance of north and northeast winds during the winter period, the long-range transport of air pollutants which emitted from the highly industrialized areas and the intensive fire regions in the southern part of China and Southeast Asia region were likely other important sources."

**Mechanism**:
- Winter: North/Northeast winds → Transport from Pearl River Delta (industrialized) + fire regions
- Summer: South/Southeast winds → Maritime air masses (cleaner)

#### 3. Regional Fire Activities
**Quote**: "The MODIS fire maps showed that fire sources occurring in the southern part of China and the Southeast Asia region (Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar) during the winter period were much more intensive than those during the summer period."

**Mechanism**:
- Intensive fires in winter → Air masses carry pollutants to Hanoi
- K+, OC, EC elevated in winter (biomass burning tracers)

#### 4. Secondary Aerosol Formation
**Quote**: "The contribution of secondary sources to the measured OC (the largest contributor to PM2.5) was larger than that of primary sources during the winter period."

- SOC contribution to OC:
  - Summer: 39.84%
  - Winter: 57.81%

#### 5. Humidity Effects
**Quote**: "There were moderately positive correlations between relative humidity and PM2.5 for both the summer and winter periods"
- High RH (>70%) → Hygroscopic growth of particles
- Enhanced aqueous-phase reactions

### Seasonal Wind Patterns
- **Summer**: Southeast wind dominant → Maritime environment (cleaner)
- **Winter**: North/Northeast winds dominant → Continental sources (polluted)

### Chemical Composition
- Major species: SO4²⁻, NH4⁺, OC, EC, K⁺
- OC largest contributor to PM2.5 mass (25-30%)
- Winter: Higher SO4²⁻, NH4⁺, K⁺, OC, EC
- Summer: Higher Na⁺, Mg²⁺ (seawater influence)

## Relevant Quotes for Extraction

1. "The average value of daily PM2.5 concentrations observed for the winter period was about 3 times higher than the counterpart for the summer period."

2. "The lower values of wind speed and boundary layer height during the winter period were favorable for the trapping of air pollutants in the ground."

3. "Air masses mainly originating from the north and northeast directions travelled through the Pearl River Delta region in the southern part of China (a highly industrialized area) before arriving at the measurement site during the winter period."

4. "The occurrence of air masses passing through the maritime environment (which was not strongly influenced by anthropogenic sources) and the less intensive fire regions during the summer period was identified as the main reason for the lower concentrations of PM2.5."
