## Key Findings

### 1. PM2.5 Levels in Hanoi
- PM2.5 levels were high during dry season (median = 62 μg/m³) 
- Low during rainy season (June and July, medians = 19 μg/m³)
- Haze episodes with PM2.5 > 100 μg/m³ observed 13 times during dry season (October 2016-March 2017)

### 2. Seasonal Variation
- PM2.5 in December and January were about three times higher than in July
- Monthly variation similar to previous research on PM2.5 levels in 2001-2008
- Seasonal variation similar to many areas in South East and East Asia

### 3. Cold Surge Events
- Haze episodes may be linked to East Asian winter monsoon
- Daily levels of PM2.5 and CO increased several days after most cold surge events
- Two events investigated at higher temporal resolution showed peaks of PM2.5 at midnight

### 4. Humidity Effects
- Hanoi has humid tropical climate demonstrating potential of sensors in high humid conditions
- Relative humidity (RH) of Hanoi during study period shown in Table 2
- Good correlation between two measurements suggests effect of nearby site sources of PM2.5 is insignificant

### 5. Key Quotes (from visible portions)
> "A year-long observation of PM2.5 concentrations was conducted in Hanoi from July 2016 to June 2017 using newly developed highly sensitive sensors."

> "Haze episodes of PM2.5 with levels higher than 100 μg m−3 were observed 13 times during the dry season (October 2016–March 2017)."

> "These episodes may be linked to the East Asian winter monsoon, as the daily levels of PM2.5 and CO increased several days after most of the cold surge events."

## Relevance to Edge Cases
This paper provides context for Hanoi-specific conditions:
1. High humidity tropical climate affects sensor measurements
2. Cold surge events linked to haze episodes
3. Seasonal variation with winter having highest PM2.5

## Note
This paper focuses more on characterization than edge-case mechanisms, but provides important Hanoi-specific context for understanding fog/haze episodes.
