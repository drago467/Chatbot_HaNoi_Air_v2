Relationships between the planetary boundary layer height and surface pollutants derived from lidar observations over China: regional pattern and influencing factors
Tianning Su, Zhanqing Li, and Ralph Kahn
Abstract

The frequent occurrence of severe air pollution episodes in China has been a great concern and thus the focus of intensive studies. Planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) is a key factor in the vertical mixing and dilution of near-surface pollutants. However, the relationship between PBLH and surface pollutants, especially particulate matter (PM) concentration across China, is not yet well understood. We investigate this issue at ∼1600 surface stations using PBLH derived from space-borne and ground-based lidar, and discuss the influence of topography and meteorological variables on the PBLH–PM relationship. Albeit the PBLH–PM correlations are roughly negative for most cases, their magnitude, significance, and even sign vary considerably with location, season, and meteorological conditions. Weak or even uncorrelated PBLH–PM relationships are found over clean regions (e.g., Pearl River Delta), whereas nonlinearly negative responses of PM to PBLH evolution are found over polluted regions (e.g., North China Plain). Relatively strong PBLH–PM interactions are found when the PBLH is shallow and PM concentration is high, which typically corresponds to wintertime cases. Correlations are much weaker over the highlands than the plains regions, which may be associated with lighter pollution loading at higher elevations and contributions from mountain breezes. The influence of horizontal transport on surface PM is considered as well, manifested as a negative correlation between surface PM and wind speed over the whole nation. Strong wind with clean upwind air plays a dominant role in removing pollutants, and leads to obscure PBLH–PM relationships. A ventilation rate is used to jointly consider horizontal and vertical dispersion, which has the largest impact on surface pollutant accumulation over the North China Plain. As such, this study contributes to improved understanding of aerosol–planetary boundary layer (PBL) interactions and thus our ability to forecast surface air pollution.

1 Introduction

In the past few decades, China has been suffering from severe air pollution, caused by both particulate matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants. PM pollutants are of greater concern to the public, partly because they are much more visible than gaseous pollution (Chan and Yao, 2008; J. Li et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2009), and because they have discernible adverse effects on human health. Moreover, airborne particles critically impact Earth's climate through aerosol direct and indirect effects (Ackerman et al., 2004; Boucher et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2017; Kiehl and Briegleb, 1993; Z. Li et al., 2016, 2017a).

Multiple factors contribute to the severe air pollution over China. Strong emission due to rapid urbanization and industrialization is a primary cause. In addition, meteorological conditions and diffusion within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) play important roles in the exchange between polluted and clean air. Among the meteorological parameters of importance, the PBL height (PBLH) can be related to the vertical mixing, affecting the dilution of pollutants emitted near the ground through various interactions and feedback mechanisms (Emeis and Schäfer, 2006; Su et al., 2017a). Therefore, PBLH is a critical parameter affecting near-surface air quality, and it serves as a key input for chemistry transport models (Knote et al., 2015; LeMone et al., 2013). The PBLH can significantly impact aerosol vertical structure, as the bulk of locally generated pollutants tends to be concentrated within this layer. Turbulent mixing within the PBL can account for much of the variability in near-surface air quality. On the other hand, aerosols can have important feedbacks on PBLH, depending on the aerosol properties, especially their light absorption (e.g., black, organic, and brown carbon; Wang et al., 2013). Multiple studies demonstrate that absorbing aerosols tend to affect surface pollution in China through their interactions with PBL meteorology (Ding et al., 2016; Miao et al., 2016; Dong et al., 2017; Petäjä et al., 2016). In a recent comprehensive review, Li et al. (2017b) present ample evidence of such interactions and characterize their determinant factors .

There are various methods for identifying the PBLH. The gradient (e.g., Johnson et al., 2001; Liu and Liang, 2010) and Richardson number methods (e.g., Vogelezang and Holtslag, 1996) are traditional and most commonly used, both of which are typically based on temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed profiles obtained by radiosondes. Using fine-resolution radiosonde observations, Guo et al. (2016) obtained the first comprehensive PBLH climatology over China. Ground-based lidars, such as the micropulse lidar (MPL), are also widely used to derive the PBLH (e.g., Hägeli et al., 2000; He et al., 2008; Sawyer and Li, 2013; Tucker et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2013). The lidar-based PBLH identification relies on the principle that a temperature inversion often exists at the top of the PBL, trapping moisture and aerosols (Seibert et al., 2000), which causes a sharp decrease in the aerosol backscatter signal at the PBL upper boundary. However, using ground-based observations to retrieve the PBLH suffers from poor spatial coverage and very limited sampling. The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) on board the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite (Winker et al., 2007), an operational spaceborne lidar, can retrieve cloud and aerosol vertical distributions at moderate vertical resolution, complementing ground-based PBLH measurements. Several studies already demonstrate both the effectiveness and the limitations of using CALIPSO data for PBLH detection, showing sound but highly variable agreement with those from radiosonde- and MPL-based PBLH results (Su et al., 2017b; Leventidou et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016).

Several studies have explored the relationship between PBLH and surface pollutants in China. Tang et al. (2016) used ceilometer measurements to derive long-term PBLH behavior in Beijing, further demonstrating the strong correlation between the PBLH and surface visibility under high humidity conditions. Wang et al. (2017) classified atmospheric dispersion conditions based on PBLH and wind speed, and identified significant surface PM changes that varied with dispersion conditions. Miao et al. (2017) investigated the relationship between summertime PBLH and surface PM, and discussed the impact of synoptic patterns on the development and structure of the PBL. Qu et al. (2017) derived 1-year PBLH variations from lidar in Nanjing, and identified a strong correlation between PBLH and PM, especially on hazy and foggy days.

However, the majority of studies considered data from only a few stations, and as yet, the interaction between PBLH and surface pollutants under different topographic and meteorological conditions is not well characterized. Assessing the relationship between PM and the PBLH quantitatively over the entire country is of particular interest. PBL turbulence is not the only factor affecting air quality, so there can be large regional differences in the interaction between the PBLH and PM. As such, the contributions of various factors to the PBLH–PM relationship remain uncertain, which thus warrants a further investigation.

Given the above-mentioned limitations, the current study presents a comprehensive exploration of the relationship between the PBLH and surface pollutants over China, for a wide range of atmospheric, aerosol, and topographic conditions. Since 2012, China has dramatically increased the number of instruments and implemented rigorous quality control procedures for hourly pollutant concentration measurements nationally, providing much better quality data than were previously available. The pollutant data derived from surface observations, along with CALIPSO measurements, offer us an opportunity to investigate the impact of PBLH on air quality on a nationwide basis. Regional characteristics and seasonal variations are considered. Moreover, multiple factors related to the interaction between the PBLH and PM are investigated, including surface topography, horizontal transport, and pollution level. Accounting for the influences these factors have on the relationships between PBLH and surface pollutants will help improve our understanding and forecasting capability for air pollution, as well as help refine meteorological and atmospheric chemistry models.

2 Data and method
2.1 Description of observations
2.1.1 Surface data

The topography of China is presented in Fig. 1a, and pink rectangles outline the four regions of interest (ROI) for the current study: northeast China (NEC), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), the Pearl River Delta (PRD), and the North China Plain (NCP). The environmental monitoring station locations are indicated with red dots in Fig. 1b. They routinely measure PM with diameters ≤2.5 µm (PM2.5), which are released to the public in real time with relatively high credibility (Liang et al., 2016). The locations of meteorological stations are indicated in Fig. 1c (data source: http://data.cma.cn/en, last access: 11 January 2018). The wind speed and wind direction at these stations are quality-controlled and archived by the China Meteorological Administration. We also utilized the MPL data and Sun-photometer data in Beijing, a megacity located within the NCP. The MPL located in Beijing was operated continuously by Peking University (39.99∘ N, 116.31∘ E) from March 2016 to December 2017, with a temporal resolution of 15 s and a vertical resolution of 15 m. The near-surface blind zone for lidar is around 150 m. Background subtraction, saturation, after-pulse, overlap, and range corrections are applied to raw MPL data (He et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2013). In this study, we use Level 1.5 aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm from the Beijing RADI (40∘ N, 116.38∘ E) Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site, with hourly time resolution. As observations from multiple sources and platforms are used, we present descriptions of these observations in Table 1.

2.1.2 CALIPSO data

CALIOP aboard the CALIPSO platform is the first space-borne lidar optimized for aerosol and cloud profiling. As part of the Afternoon satellite constellation, or A-Train (L'Ecuyer and Jiang, 2010), CALIPSO is in a 705 km Sun-synchronous polar orbit between 82∘ N and 82∘ S, with a 16-day repeat cycle (Winker et al., 2007, 2009). In this study, we used the CALIPSO data to retrieve the daytime PBLH along its orbit. As shown in Fig. 1d, blue lines represent the ground tracks over China for the daytime overpasses of CALIPSO. To match the CALIPSO retrievals with equator crossings at approximately 13:30 local time, we use the surface meteorological and environmental data in the early afternoon averaged from 13:00 to 15:00 China standard time (CST). During this period, the PBL is well developed with relatively strong vertical mixing, which is a favorable condition for investigating aerosol–PBL interactions.

2.1.3 MODIS data

The MODIS instruments on board the NASA Terra and Aqua satellites have 2330 km swath widths, and provide daily AOD data with near-global coverage. In this study, we use the Collection 6 MODIS-Aqua Level-2 AOD products at 550 nm (available at: https://www.nasa.gov/langley, last access: 15 January 2018), which is a widely used parameter to represent the columnar aerosol amount. AOD data are archived with a nominal spatial resolution of 10 km × 10 km, and the data are averaged within a 30 km radius around the environmental stations to match surface PM2.5 data. The MODIS land AOD accuracy is reported to be within ± 0.05+15 % of AERONET AOD (Levy et al., 2010). Note that aerosol loading is significantly different in different regions. To account for the background pollution level, we normalize the PM2.5 with MODIS AOD to qualitatively account for background or transported aerosol that is not concentrated in the PBL.

2.2 Retrieving PBLHs
2.2.1 PBLH derived from MPL

MPL data from Beijing were used to retrieve the PBLH for this study. Multiple methods have been developed for retrieving the PBLH from MPL measurements, such as signal threshold (Melfi et al., 1985), maximum of the signal variance (Hooper and Eloranta, 1986), minimum of the signal profile derivative (Flamant et al., 1997), and wavelet transform (Cohn and Angevine, 2000; Davis et al., 2000). To derive the PBLH from MPL data, we implement a well-established method developed by Yang et al. (2013) and adopted in multiple studies (Lin et al., 2016; Su et al., 2017a, b). This method is tested to be suitable for processing long-term lidar data. Initially, the first derivative of a Gaussian filter with a wavelet dilation of 60 m is applied to smooth the vertical profile of MPL signals and to produce the gradient profile. The aerosol stratification structure is indicated by multiple valleys and peaks in the gradient profile. To exclude misidentified elevated aerosol layers above the PBL, the first significant peak in the gradient profile (if one exists) is considered the upper limit in searching for the PBL top. Then, the height of the deepest valley in the gradient profile is attributed to the PBLH; discontinuous or false results caused by clouds are subsequently eliminated manually. Moreover, we further estimated the shot noise (σ) induced by background light and dark current for each profile, and then added threshold values of ±3σ to the identified peaks and valleys of this profile to reduce the impact of noise. Figure S1 in the Supplement presents an example of the PBLH retrievals derived from MPL backscatter over Beijing. To validate MPL-derived PBLH, the values are compared with summertime radiosonde PBLH results retrieved using the Richardson number method (e.g., Vogelezang and Holtslag, 1996) from potential temperature profiles acquired at the Beijing station (39.80∘ N, 116.47∘ E) at 14:00 CST. Figure S2a shows good agreement (
) between MPL- and radiosonde-derived PBLHs over Beijing.
