## Key Findings về Transport Mechanisms

### 1. Synoptic Meteorology → Transboundary Transport → PM2.5 Enhancement
- **Mechanism**: Contrasting synoptic air circulations triggered different transport mechanisms
- **Quote**: "PM2.5 concentrations during the events were 100% and 115% higher on average compared to local accumulation periods in the same months"
- **Conditions**: Specific synoptic patterns

### 2. Upper-level Ridge + Low-pressure System → Northeasterly Winds → China Anthropogenic PM2.5 Transport
- **Mechanism**: Anthropogenic PM2.5 emissions in continental East Asia fed the 2013 event, transported by strong northeasterly winds triggered by an upper-level ridge near the Tibetan Plateau and a low-pressure system in western Pacific Ocean
- **Quote**: "Anthropogenic PM2.5 emissions in continental East Asia fed the 2013 event, which was then transported by strong northeasterly winds triggered by an upper-level ridge near the Tibetan Plateau and a low-pressure system in western Pacific Ocean"
- **Conditions**: Upper-level ridge near Tibetan Plateau, low-pressure in western Pacific

### 3. El Niño → Western Pacific Subtropical High → Indonesia Biomass Burning Transport
- **Mechanism**: Indonesia biomass burning was enhanced and transported by a westward propagating Western Pacific Subtropical High triggered by a strong El Niño event
- **Quote**: "the 2015 event was the result of Indonesia biomass burning (BB), which was enhanced and transported by a westward propagating Western Pacific Subtropical High triggered by a strong El Niño event"
- **Conditions**: Strong El Niño event, July-October period

### 4. East Asian Monsoon → Transboundary Pollution from China
- **Mechanism**: East Asian monsoon activity in winter drives much of the transboundary air pollution from China and significantly impacts downwind neighboring countries
- **Quote**: "East Asian monsoon activity in winter drives much of the transboundary air pollution from China and significantly impacts downwind neighboring countries"
- **Conditions**: Winter monsoon period

### 5. Climate Change → Increased El Niño → More Transboundary BB Events
- **Mechanism**: Future climate change will likely increase the number of extreme El Niño events, leading to the increase of transboundary Indonesia BB events
- **Quote**: "Future climate change will likely increase the number of extreme El Niño events, leading to the increase of transboundary Indonesia BB events to HCMC"

## Spatial Scope
