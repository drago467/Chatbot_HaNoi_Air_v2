# Causal Chains: Cold Surge Mechanisms and PM2.5 in Hanoi

## Executive Summary

This report presents a systematic extraction of causal chains explaining how cold surges affect PM2.5 concentrations in Hanoi, Vietnam. Based on analysis of 7 Tier-1 peer-reviewed sources, we identified **6 distinct causal chains** with 3-4 intermediate nodes each, covering both regional transport and local accumulation mechanisms.

The research reveals that cold surges impact PM2.5 through two primary pathways: (1) **regional transport during onset** causing ~30% PM2.5 increase, and (2) **local stagnation during persistence** causing ~40% PM2.5 increase. These mechanisms operate within characteristic monsoon cycles averaging 4 days, with pollution levels lowest during surge onset and peaking at mid-cycle.

## 2. Causal Chains

### Chain 1: Cold Surge Onset → Regional Transport

**Mechanism Type**: Regional Transport  
**Temporal Phase**: Onset  
**PM2.5 Impact**: +30%

```
Siberian High Intensification
        ↓
Cold Surge Onset (NE winds)
        ↓
Air Mass Trajectory Shift (NE trajectories)
        ↓
Regional Pollution Advection (from E. China, Red River Delta)
        ↓
PM2.5 Increase at Hanoi
```

**Key Evidence**:
> "During cold surge onsets, long-range transport from China causes an average increase of ~30% in PM2.5 concentrations." — Phung-Ngoc et al. (2023)

> "PM2.5 driven by cold surges from the ground level could travel up to 2000 km from northern to southern China within two days." — Wang et al. (2017)

---

### Chain 2: Cold Surge Persistence → Local Stagnation

**Mechanism Type**: Local Accumulation  
**Temporal Phase**: Persistence  
**PM2.5 Impact**: +40%

```
Cold Surge Persistence
        ↓
Anticyclonic Conditions (prolonged high pressure)
        ↓
Synoptic Stagnation (weak winds, stable atmosphere)
        ↓
Reduced Dispersion (limited horizontal/vertical mixing)
        ↓
Local Pollution Accumulation
        ↓
PM2.5 Increase
```

**Key Evidence**:
> "The stagnation of local pollution during the cold surges persistence causes an average increase of ~40% in level of PM2.5." — Phung-Ngoc et al. (2023)

> "A dozen multi-day pollution episodes occur from October to February in Hanoi, Vietnam due to prolonged anticyclonic conditions established after the northeast monsoon surges." — Hien et al. (2011)

---

### Chain 3: Temperature Inversion → Vertical Mixing Suppression

**Mechanism Type**: Vertical Mixing Suppression  
**Temporal Phase**: Persistence  
**PM2.5 Impact**: 2× nighttime vs daytime (NRTI), equal day/night (STI)

```
Cold Surge Phase (Dry or Humid)
        ↓
Temperature Inversion Formation
  ├── NRTI (Dry phase via inland China)
  └── STI (Humid phase via East China Sea)
        ↓
Boundary Layer Height Decrease (<1000m during hazy days)
        ↓
Vertical Mixing Suppression
        ↓
PM2.5 Accumulation in Shallow Boundary Layer
```

**Key Evidence**:
> "WPEs are associated with nighttime radiation temperature inversions (NRTIs) in the dry phase and subsidence temperature inversions (STIs) in the humid phase." — Hien et al. (2011)

> "BLH proved to be one of the key factors controlling air pollution in Hanoi. The lower BLH on the hazy days weakened the vertical mixing and was directly related to an increase in aerosol concentrations at the surface." — Ngoc et al. (2021)

---

### Chain 4: Post-Cold Surge Secondary Aerosol Formation

**Mechanism Type**: Secondary Formation  
**Temporal Phase**: Post-Surge  
**PM2.5 Impact**: >100 µg/m³ episodes

```
Cold Surge Passage
        ↓
Post-Surge Stagnation (calm conditions)
        ↓
Precursor Accumulation (SO2, NOx, VOCs)
        ↓
Secondary Aerosol Formation (gas-to-particle conversion)
        ↓
Nighttime PM2.5 Peak
```

**Key Evidence**:
> "The PM2.5 peak, which often appeared at night after a cold surge, may be the result of secondary particle formation under stagnant conditions." — Ly et al. (2018)

> "Daily levels of PM2.5 and CO increased several days after most cold surge events." — Ly et al. (2018)

---

### Chain 5: Monsoon Cycle Evolution

**Mechanism Type**: Temporal Evolution  
**Temporal Phase**: Full Cycle (~4 days)  
**PM2.5 Impact**: Lowest during surge → Peak at mid-cycle

```
Cold Surge Onset (high winds)
        ↓
High Wind Dispersion → Pollution Minimum
        ↓
Post-Surge Stagnation (anticyclone establishes)
        ↓
Pollution Rise (accumulation begins)
        ↓
Mid-Cycle Peak (maximum pollution)
        ↓
Pre-Surge Decline (next surge approaching)
```

**Key Evidence**:
> "The 24-h pollutant concentrations are lowest during cold surges; concurrently rise thereafter reaching the highest levels toward the middle of a monsoon cycle, then decline ahead of the next cold surge." — Hien et al. (2011)

### Chain 6: Long-Range Transport in Lower Troposphere

**Mechanism Type**: Long-Range Transport  
**Temporal Phase**: Onset  
**PM2.5 Impact**: Double winter average at receptor

```
Siberian High
        ↓
Strong Northwesterly Winds (>20 m/s)
        ↓
Cold Surge Development
        ↓
Lower Troposphere Transport (ground-level PM2.5)
        ↓
Rapid Southward Advection (2000 km in 2 days)
        ↓
Receptor PM2.5 Increase
```

**Key Evidence**:
> "PM2.5 driven by cold surges from the ground level could travel up to 2000 km from northern to southern China within two days." — Wang et al. (2017)

> "This finding is a new long-range transport mechanism comparing to the well-established mechanism, with long-range transport more likely to occur in the upper troposphere than at lower levels." — Wang et al. (2017)

## 3. Synthesis

### Primary Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description | PM2.5 Impact | Key Variables |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Regional Transport (Onset) | NE winds transport polluted air from China | +30% | Air mass trajectory, upwind exposure |
| Local Stagnation (Persistence) | Anticyclonic conditions trap local emissions | +40% | Synoptic stagnation, reduced dispersion |
| Secondary Formation (Post-Surge) | Stagnation promotes gas-to-particle conversion | >100 µg/m³ | Precursor accumulation, nighttime cooling |

### Temporal Pattern

The cold surge-PM2.5 relationship follows a characteristic temporal pattern within each monsoon cycle:

| Phase | Duration | PM2.5 Effect |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Onset | 1-2 days | Initial transport increase (~30%), then dispersion |
| Persistence | 2-4 days | Stagnation accumulation (~40% increase) |
| Mid-cycle | 1-2 days | Peak pollution levels |
| Pre-next surge | 1 day | Decline as next surge approaches |

### Key Intermediate Variables

The following variables serve as critical intermediate nodes in the causal chains:

| Variable | Role | Sources |
|----------|------|---------|
| Boundary Layer Height | Determines vertical mixing capacity; BLH < 1000m during hazy days | S5 |
| Temperature Inversion | NRTI (dry phase) or STI (humid phase) suppress vertical mixing | S4 |
| Wind Speed | High during surge (dispersion/transport), low during persistence (stagnation) | S4, S6 |
| Air Mass Trajectory | Determines upwind source regions and pollution loading | S1, S5, S7 |
