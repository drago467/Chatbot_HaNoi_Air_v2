Abstract
Particulate matter (PM) is a major source of urban air pollution that poses a serious threat to the environment and human health. This study quantified the dry deposition effect of PM2.5 and PM10 on vegetation using a mathematical model to overcome the limitations of traditional site-scale research. Additionally, multi-source satellite remote sensing products were combined to form a raster dataset to estimate the effect of dry deposition on PM2.5 and PM10 in China's urban green spaces from 2000 to 2020. The spatial and temporal changes in the long-term series were analyzed, and the influence of environmental factors on dry deposition was analyzed in combination with wavelet changes. The experimental results showed that: 1) from 2000 to 2020, the dry deposition effect of PM2.5 and PM10 on vegetation showed an initial increasing and then decreasing trend caused by the sudden drop in atmospheric pollutant particle concentration driven by local policies; 2) broad-leaved forests provided the main dry deposition effects in urban spaces, accounting for 89.22 %, indicating a need to increase the density of these forest types in urban development planning to improve air quality; and 3) PM2.5, PM10, and environmental impact factors have time-frequency scale coherences, and the coherence between PM2.5 reduction and these factors is more complex than that of PM10, with precipitation being the best variable to explain the change in PM2.5 and PM10. These findings are important for the prevention and control of urban air pollution, regional planning of green spaces, and sustainable development of cities.

Introduction
Due to the rapid rise of regional industrialization, urbanization, and economic growth, air pollution has significantly increased, thereby impeding the sustainable development of urban ecosystems. The increase in air pollution poses a significant risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, while also altering regional climate and meteorological phenomena. Therefore, it is imperative to implement measures to prevent and control air pollution (Schwartz et al., 1996; Tai et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2020; Rahman et al., 2022). Particulate Matter (PM) encompasses solid or liquid particles such as dust, soot, and chemicals that become suspended in the air. These particles enter the atmosphere through industrial emissions, automobile exhaust, and agricultural and residential activities (Viana et al., 2008; Dominici et al., 2014). PM represents a crucial component of urban air pollution (Beckett et al., 1998; Yang et al., 2005; Shah et al., 2022). The development of cities has raised significant environmental concerns regarding the reduction of PM emissions. Urban green spaces, comprising both artificial and natural green vegetation coverage within urban areas, including forest parks, river wetlands, and street green belts, play a crucial role in purifying the air in urban environments (Wu et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2017; Zhai et al., 2022a, Zhai et al., 2022b). Air purification is either achieved by the direct interception and absorption of PM by vegetation through retention, attachment, and adhesion, or by changing meteorological factors such as wind fields. The dust retention effect is influenced by the canopy structure, growth stage, and leaf roughness of plants within the green space (Zhao et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Fan et al., 2015; Zhai et al., 2022c).
The process of vegetation directly reducing atmospheric PM is known as dry deposition. However, accurately estimating this process using simple empirical mathematical relationships poses challenges (Pretzsch et al., 2015; DeJarnett et al., 2016). Early models predominantly relied on simplistic estimations of dry deposition processes by primarily considering theories in aerodynamics and micrometeorology. These models neglected the impact of plant structural characteristics and species variations, while also insufficiently quantifying several parameters (Davidson et al., 1982; Slinn, 1982). As research on dry deposition progresses, more advanced models have been developed, notably the widely utilized ENVI-met and Urban Forest Effects (UFORE) models (Hirabayashi, 2011; Velásquez Ciro et al., 2021). The ENVI-met model is a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model that effectively simulates the interaction among the subsurface, vegetation, and atmosphere. It is commonly employed for simulating urban microenvironments and assessing the effects of green spaces (Bruse and Fleer, 1998). In a study conducted by Vos et al. (2013) using ENVI-met, the effect of roadside green belt structure on atmospheric quality was investigated. The study indicated a positive correlation with depression and a negative correlation with permeability, although the underlying mechanism concerning vegetation remained unclear. The UFORE model, developed by the Northeast Forest Research Centre of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the 1990s, offers the capability to quantitatively assess the structure and function of urban green spaces. It can be applied to areas of any size both urban and non-urban, thereby providing valuable insights (Nowak, 2021; Nowak and Crane, 2000; Pace et al., 2021). The model integrates various parameters such as leaf area, pollutant concentration, and dry deposition, using measurements or remote sensing. It incorporates factors such as wind speed (WS) and precipitation (PRE) and optimizes the different pollutants and vegetation characteristics, thereby ensuring highly accurate calculation results (Hirabayashi, 2011; Nowak and Crane, 2000). The model combines various parameters to simulate the physical processes of pollutant deposition, avoiding the limitations of traditional methods that rely on empirical parameters specific to different locations (Nowak et al., 2014a). To address the complexity of component interactions, Guidolotti et al. proposed the EMEP MSC-W model to reduce the dry deposition per tree and compared its results with those of the UFORE model. The comparison revealed a consistent trend between the two models, although it is worth noting that they are still limited by the fact that large-scale estimates are limited due to the availability of on-site data (Guidolotti et al., 2016).
These models undergo constant updates and iterations to keep pace with advancing technology and expanding research requirements. One major trend is their integration with other methods. For instance, the USDA has combined the dry deposition module of UFORE with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to form the i-Tree model. This model quantifies the contribution of urban green spaces by combining spatially referenced raster data from multiple sources, including atmospheric pollutants, thus overcoming the limitations of previous models that homogenize parameters such as meteorology data and pollutant concentrations (Nowak, 2021). Yin et al. utilized the UFORE to evaluate the dust retention levels of individual trees and plots in 176 urban parks. They analyzed parameters such as tree coverage, species richness, and average crown width (Yin et al., 2022). Gong et al. (2021) employed bistable isotopes and the UFORE to accurately evaluate the NOx reduction of four types of trees (Sophora japonica, Fraxinus chinensis, Populus tomentosa, and Juniperus chinensis). Their study highlighted the vital role of urban green spaces in urban development and management (Gong et al., 2021). Nowak et al. estimated air pollutant levels, including PM2.5 and PM10, and the impact of dry deposits in forests and shrubs across 55 urban areas of the United States in 1994. Their findings demonstrated a total reduction of 711,000 tons with an estimated economic value of USD 3.8 billion, underscoring the irreplaceable economic and ecological value of dry deposition (Nowak et al., 2006; Nowak et al., 2018; Gong et al., 2022).
Although numerous studies have estimated the impact of dry deposition on atmospheric PM in urban green spaces (Table 1), most have relied on on-site data. Conducting continuous analyses over extended periods and at large regional spatial scales poses challenges, resulting in limited comprehensive studies being conducted on different regions in China. Hence, this study aimed to analyze the spatial and temporal changes in PM2.5, PM10, and the dry deposition effects of vegetation in China from 2000 to 2020. The analysis utilized the UFORE model, multi-source satellite remote sensing data, and wavelet coherence (WC) to investigate the relationship between multiple factors and dry deposition. The findings of this study hold significant implications for mitigating urban air pollution, guiding regional green space planning, and fostering sustainable urban development.

Study area
China is located in East Asia on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean, with a land area of approximately 9.6 million km2 and a continental coastline of >18,000 km. As shown in Fig. 1, the regional vegetation in China has the following characteristics (Qin et al., 2020): 1) it is affected by the monsoon climate, and a large area of subtropical, evergreen, broad-leaved forest is distributed in the central part; 2) it spans a wide range of latitudes and longitudes; hence, the region has forests,
Theory
The technical route shown in Fig. 2 was used to estimate and analyze the dry deposition of atmospheric PM in urban green spaces in China from 2000 to 2020. The process could be divided into the following three parts: 1) data preprocessing – vector synthesis, outlier removal, and downsampling of the original input data are required to ensure that a raster dataset with unified resolution and projection is obtained as the input data for subsequent dry deposition estimation; 2) data processing –
Analysis of dry deposition temporal and spatial variations
The assessment of the cleaning capacity of urban green spaces in this study was related to several factors, such as air pollutant concentration, vegetation, and meteorological factors, which affect the final spatial distribution of the dry deposition flux. Regardless of the changes driven by multiple factors over the past 2 decades, these input factors have common spatial characteristics that significantly impact the results. Fig. 4 shows the spatial distribution of the input parameters for
Discussion
The removal of atmospheric pollutants by urban green spaces has been widely studied; however, some differences remain in the estimation methods and application scenarios (Nowak and Crane, 2000; Nowak et al., 2014a; Zhai et al., 2022c). Dry deposition in urban green spaces is affected by numerous factors, such as vegetation characteristics, environmental factors, and human activities, as well as variables used in the UFORE model, such as changes in the atmospheric boundary layer height,
Conclusions
Based on the UFORE algorithm, this study overcame the limitations of traditional site-scale research by combining multi-source satellite remote sensing products to form a dry deposition estimation raster dataset of PM2.5 and PM10 for China's urban green spaces from 2000 to 2020. Additionally, the spatio-temporal changes in the long-term series were analyzed and wavelet coherence was combined to analyze the impact of environmental factors on dry deposition, thus providing a scientific reference
