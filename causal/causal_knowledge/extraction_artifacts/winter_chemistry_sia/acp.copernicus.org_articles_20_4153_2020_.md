Formation mechanisms of atmospheric nitrate and sulfate during the winter haze pollution periods in Beijing: gas-phase, heterogeneous and aqueous-phase chemistry
Pengfei Liu, Can Ye, Chaoyang Xue, Chenglong Zhang, Yujing Mu, and Xu Sun
Abstract

A vast area in China is currently going through severe haze episodes with drastically elevated concentrations of PM2.5 in winter. Nitrate and sulfate are the main constituents of PM2.5, but their formations via NO2 and SO2 oxidation are still not comprehensively understood, especially under different pollution or atmospheric relative humidity (RH) conditions. To elucidate formation pathways of nitrate and sulfate in different polluted cases, hourly samples of PM2.5 were collected continuously in Beijing during the wintertime of 2016. Three serious pollution cases were identified reasonably during the sampling period, and the secondary formations of nitrate and sulfate were found to make a dominant contribution to atmospheric PM2.5 under the relatively high RH condition. The significant correlation between NOR, NOR = 
, and [NO2]2 × [O3] during the nighttime under the RH≥60 % condition indicated that the heterogeneous hydrolysis of N2O5 involving aerosol liquid water was responsible for the nocturnal formation of nitrate at the extremely high RH levels. The more often coincident trend of NOR and [HONO] × [DR] (direct radiation) × [NO2] compared to its occurrence with [Dust] × [NO2] during the daytime under the 30 % < RH < 60 % condition provided convincing evidence that the gas-phase reaction of NO2 with OH played a pivotal role in the diurnal formation of nitrate at moderate RH levels. The extremely high mean values of SOR, SOR = 
, during the whole day under the RH≥60 % condition could be ascribed to the evident contribution of SO2 aqueous-phase oxidation to the formation of sulfate during the severe pollution episodes. Based on the parameters measured in this study and the known sulfate production rate calculation method, the oxidation pathway of H2O2 rather than NO2 was found to contribute greatly to the aqueous-phase formation of sulfate.

1 Introduction

In recent years, severe haze has occurred frequently in Beijing as well as the North China Plain (NCP) during the wintertime, which has aroused great attention from the public due to its adverse impact on atmospheric visibility, air quality and human health (Chan and Yao, 2008; Zhang et al., 2012, 2015).

To mitigate the severe haze pollution situations, a series of regulatory measures for primary pollution sources have been implemented by the Chinese government. For example, coal combustion for heating in winter has gradually been replaced with electricity and natural gas in the NCP, coal-fired power plants have been strictly required to install flue-gas denitration and desulfurization systems (Chen et al., 2014), stricter control measures such as terminating production in industries and construction as well as the odd and even number rule for vehicles have been performed in megacities during the period of the red alert for haze. These actions have had tremendous effects on reducing pollution levels of primary pollutants including PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 µm) in recent years (Li et al., 2019). However, serious pollution events still occurred in many areas of Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region in December 2016 and January 2017 (Li et al., 2019). It has been acknowledged that the severe haze pollution is mainly ascribed to stagnant meteorological conditions with high atmospheric relative humidity (RH) and low mixed boundary layer height, strong emissions of primary gaseous pollutants, and rapid formation of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs, the sum of sulfate, nitrate and ammonium), especially sulfate and nitrate (Cheng et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2014). Some studies suggested that the contribution of SIAs to PM2.5 was higher than 50 % during the most serious haze days (Quan et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2015a).

Generally, atmospheric sulfate and nitrate are formed through the oxidations of the precursor gases (SO2 and NO2) by oxidants (e.g., OH radicals, O3) via gas-phase, heterogeneous and aqueous-phase reactions (Ravishankara, 1997; Wang et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015). It should be noted that a recent study proposed remarkable emissions of primary sulfate from residential coal combustion with the sulfur content of coal in the range of 0.81 %–1.88 % in Xi'an (Dai et al., 2019), but the primary emissions of sulfate can be neglected due to the extremely low sulfur content of coal (0.26 %–0.34 %) used prevailingly in the NCP (Du et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016). Atmospheric RH is a key factor that facilitates SIA formation and aggravates the haze pollution (Wu et al., 2019), and hence the secondary formations of sulfate and nitrate are simply considered to be mainly via gas-phase reactions at relatively low atmospheric RH levels (RH<30 %) and heterogeneous reactions and aqueous-phase reactions at relatively high atmospheric RH levels (RH>60 %) (Li et al., 2017). However, their formation mechanisms at different atmospheric RH levels still remain controversial and unclear (Cheng et al., 2016; Ge et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; M. Liu et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017). For example, recent studies proposed that atmospheric SO2 oxidation by NO2 dissolved in aqueous aerosol phases under the extremely high atmospheric RH conditions played a dominant role in sulfate formation under almost-neutral aerosol solutions (a pH range of 5.4–7.0) during the serious pollution periods (Cheng et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018, 2016). However, M. Liu et al. (2017) and Guo et al. (2017) found that the aerosol pH estimated by the ISORROPIA II model was moderately acidic (a pH range of 3.0–4.9), and thus the pathway of SO2 aqueous-phase oxidation by dissolved NO2 was unimportant during severe haze events in China. Additionally, although the pathway of N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis has been recognized as being responsible for the nocturnal formation of 
 under relatively high atmospheric RH conditions (Tham et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018a, b), the effects of NO2 gas-phase chemistry and NO2 heterogeneous chemistry on the diurnal formation of 
 under moderate atmospheric RH conditions (30 % < RH < 60 %) have not yet been understood. Therefore, measurements of the species in PM2.5 in different polluted cases during the wintertime are urgently needed to elucidate formation pathways of sulfate and nitrate.

In this study, hourly filter samples of PM2.5 were collected continuously in Beijing during the wintertime of 2016, and the pollution characteristics and formation mechanisms of sulfate and nitrate in the PM2.5 samples were investigated comprehensively under different atmospheric RH conditions in relation to gas-phase, heterogeneous and aqueous-phase chemistry.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 Sampling and analysis

The sampling site was chosen on the rooftop (around 25 m above the ground) of a six-story building at Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (RCEES, CAS), which is located in the northwest of Beijing and has been described in detail by our previous studies (P. Liu et al., 2016, 2017). The location of the sampling site (40∘00′29.85′′ N, 116∘20′29.71′′ E) is presented in Fig. S1 in the Supplement. Hourly PM2.5 samples were collected on prebaked quartz fiber filters (90 mm, Munktell) from 7 to 23 January 2016 by median-volume samplers (Laoying-2030) with a flow rate of 100 L min−1. Water-soluble ions (WSIs), including Na+, 
, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, Cl−, 
, 
 and 
, as well as carbon components including organic carbon (OC) and element carbon (EC) in the filter samples, were analyzed by ion chromatography (Wayeal IC6200) and a thermal optical carbon analyzer (DRI Model 2001A), respectively (P. Liu et al., 2017). Analysis relevant for quality assurance & quality control (QA/QC) was presented in detail in Sect. S1 of the Supplement. Atmospheric H2O2 and HONO were monitored by an AL2021-H2O2 monitor (Aero-Laser GmbH, Germany) and a set of double-wall glass stripping coil samplers coupled with ion chromatography (SC-IC), respectively (Ye et al., 2018; Xue et al., 2019a, b). More details about the measurements of H2O2 and HONO are described in Sect. S2. Meteorological data, including wind speed, wind direction, ambient temperature and RH, as well as air quality index (AQI) derived from PM2.5, SO2, NOx, CO and O3, were obtained from Beijing urban ecosystem research station in RCEES, CAS (http://www.bjurban.rcees.cas.cn/, last access: 6 June 2019).

2.2 Aerosol liquid water content and pH prediction by the ISORROPIA II model

The ISORROPIA II model was employed to calculate the equilibrium composition for the Na+–K+–Ca2+–Mg2+–
–Cl−–
–
–H2O aerosol system, which is widely used in regional and global atmospheric models and has been successfully applied in numerous studies for predicting the physical state and composition of atmospheric inorganic aerosols (Fountoukis and Nenes, 2007; Guo et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2017). It can be used in two modes: forward mode and reverse mode. Forward mode calculates the equilibrium partitioning given the total concentrations of gas and aerosol species, whereas reverse mode involves predicting the thermodynamic compositions based only on the concentrations of aerosol components. Forward mode was adopted in this study because reverse mode calculations have been verified to be not suitable to characterize aerosol acidity (Guo et al., 2015; Hennigan et al., 2015; Murphy et al., 2017; Pathak et al., 2004; Weber et al., 2016). The ISORROPIA II model is available in “metastable” or “solid + liquid” state solutions. Considering the relatively high RH during the sampling period, the metastable state solution was selected in this study due to its better performance than the latter (Bougiatioti et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2015; M. Liu et al., 2017; Weber et al., 2016). Additionally, although the gaseous HNO3, H2SO4 HCl and NH3 were not measured in this study, gas-phase input with the exception of NH3 has an insignificant impact on the aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) and pH calculation due to the lower concentrations of HNO3, H2SO4 and HCl as compared with NH3 in the atmosphere (Ding et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2017). Based on the long-term measurement in the winter in Beijing, an empirical equation between NOx and NH3 concentrations was derived from the previous study (Meng et al., 2011), that is, NH3 (in parts per billion) = 0.34×NOx (in parts per billion) + 0.63, which was employed for estimating the NH3 concentration in this study. The predicted daily average concentrations of NH3 varied from 3.3 to 36.9 µg m−3, with a mean value of 16.6 and a median value of 14.6 µg m−3, which were in line with those (7.6–38.1, 18.2 and 16.2 µg m−3 for the daily average concentrations, the mean value and the median value of NH3, respectively) during the winter of 2013 in Beijing in the previous study (Zhao et al., 2016).

Then, the aerosol pH can be calculated by the following equation:

where H+ (in micrograms per cubic meter) and W (in micrograms per cubic meter) are the equilibrium particle hydrogen ion concentration and aerosol water content, respectively, both of which can be output from ISORROPIA II.

2.3 Production of sulfate in aqueous-phase reactions

The previous studies showed that there were six pathways from the aqueous-phase oxidation of SO2 to the production of sulfate, i.e., H2O2 oxidation, O3 oxidation, NO2 oxidation, transition metal ions (TMIs) + O2 oxidation, methyl hydrogen peroxide (MHP) oxidation and peroxyacetic acid (PAA) oxidation (Cheng et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2015a). Because some TMIs, such as Ti(III), V(III), Cr(III), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II), displayed much less catalytic activity (Cheng et al., 2016), only Fe(III) and Mn(II) were considered in this study. In addition, due to the extremely low concentrations of MHP and PAA in the atmosphere, their contributions to the production of sulfate can be ignored (Zheng et al., 2015a). To investigate the formation mechanism of sulfate during the serious pollution episodes, the contributions of O3, H2O2, NO2 and Fe(III) + Mn(II) to the production of sulfate in aqueous-phase reactions were calculated by formulas as follows (Cheng et al., 2016; Ibusuki and Takeuchi, 1987; Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006):

where 
 M−1 s−1, 
 M−1 s−1, 
 M−1 s−1, 
 M−1 s−1, K=13 M−1, 
 M−1 s−1, and 
 (for pH ≤ 4.2) or 
 M−1 s−1, and a=0.67 (for pH > 4.2) and k5 = (1.24–1.67) × 107 M−1 s−1 (for 
; the linear interpolated values were used for pH between 5.3 and 8.7) at 298 K (Clifton et al., 1988); [O3(aq)], [H2O2(aq)] and [NO2(aq)] can be calculated by the Henry's constants, which are 
, 1.0×105 and 
 M atm−1 at 298 K for O3, H2O2 and NO2 respectively (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006). As for [Fe(III)] and [Mn(II)], their concentrations entirely depended on the values of pH due to the precipitation equilibriums of Fe(OH)3 and Mn(OH)2 (Graedel and Weschler, 1981). Considering the aqueous-phase ionization equilibrium of SO2, the Henry's constants of 
, 
 and S(IV) can be expressed by the equations as follows (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006):

where 
 M atm−1, 
 M and 
 M at 298 K. In addition, all of the rate constants (k), Henry's constants (H) and ionization constants (K) are evidently influenced by the ambient temperature and are calibrated by formulas as follows (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006):

where T is the ambient temperature, T0=298 K; both E∕R and ΔH∕R varied in the different equations, and their values can be found in Cheng et al. (2016).

Furthermore, mass transport was also considered for multiphase reactions in different medium and across the interface in Sect. S3.

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Variation characteristics of the species in PM2.5 and typical gaseous pollutants

The concentrations of the species in PM2.5 and typical gaseous pollutants including NO2, SO2, O3, HONO and H2O2 as well as atmospheric RH are shown in Fig. 1. The meteorological parameters – wind speed, wind direction, ambient temperature and direct radiation (DR) – and the concentrations of PM2.5 are displayed in Fig. S2. During the sampling period, the concentrations of the species in PM2.5 and typical gaseous pollutants varied similarly on a timescale of hours with a distinct periodic cycle of 3–4 d, suggesting that meteorological conditions played a vital role in accumulation and dispersion of atmospheric pollutants (Xu et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2015b). For example, the relatively high levels of PM2.5 (>100 µg m−3) usually occurred under the relatively stable meteorological conditions with the low south wind speed (<2 m s−1) and high RH (>60 %), which favored the accumulation of pollutants. Besides meteorological conditions, the extremely high concentrations of the species in PM2.5 might be mainly ascribed to strong emissions of primary pollutants and rapid formation of secondary aerosols during the wintertime in Beijing.
