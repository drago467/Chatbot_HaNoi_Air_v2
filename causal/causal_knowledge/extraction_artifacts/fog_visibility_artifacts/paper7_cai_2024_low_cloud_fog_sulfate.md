## Key Findings

### 1. High Sulfur Oxidation Ratios Associated with Low Clouds and Fog
High sulfur oxidation ratios (>0.6) under heavily polluted conditions are associated with low clouds and fog over NCP, induced by the moist southerly airflow.

### 2. Sulfate Production Rate in Cloud Water
The sulfate production rate in cloud water can reach 0.5-1.3 μg m⁻³ h⁻¹, overwhelmingly exceeding the sulfate formation rate in the gas phase and in aerosol water.

### 3. Vertical Mixing of Sulfate
The sulfate produced within the clouds was deposited to the surface via vertical mixing, together with sulfate produced in the fog at the surface, which exerted an important impact on the rapid sulfate production and haze formation.

### 4. Frequency of Low Cloud Events
The frequency of such low cloud events in winter in NCP is 20.8%, highlighting the important role of in-cloud sulfate production.

> "Sulfate aerosol greatly contributes to wintertime haze pollution in emission-intensive regions like the North China Plain (NCP) in China."

> "High sulfur oxidation ratios (>0.6) under heavily polluted conditions are associated with low clouds and fog over NCP, induced by the moist southerly airflow."

> "The sulfate production rate in cloud water can reach 0.5–1.3 μg m⁻³ h⁻¹."

> "The results demonstrate that the vertical mixing of sulfate generated within the cloud water to the surface plays a significant role in rapid sulfate production, highlighting the importance of understanding cloud-water processes in haze pollution."

> "For cloud-free conditions, multiphase sulfate chemistry in aerosol water may become the dominant sulfate production pathway."

## Relevance to Edge Cases
This paper is highly relevant to the edge case of fog/low_cloud → accelerated_aqueous_phase_reaction:
1. Provides quantitative evidence for sulfate production rate in fog/cloud water
2. Explains the mechanism of vertical mixing bringing cloud-produced sulfate to surface
3. Distinguishes between cloud-based and aerosol-water-based sulfate formation pathways
