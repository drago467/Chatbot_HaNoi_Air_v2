# Research Notes: Static Factors Affecting PM2.5

## 1. Population Density
**Source:** Hien et al. (2020) - Impact of urban expansion on the air pollution landscape: A case study of Hanoi, Vietnam
- DOI: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134635
- **Key Finding:** Population density is a significant driver of spatial variations in pollutant concentrations (NO2, SO2)
- **Mechanism:** Higher population density → more traffic, industrial, and residential emission sources → higher PM2.5
- **Quantitative:** NO2 ranged from 5.5 to 70 µg/m³ across Hanoi, with concentrations decreasing from city center outward

## 2. Land Use and Land Cover (LULC)
**Source:** Yang & Jiang (2021) - Evaluating the influence of land use and land cover change on fine particulate matter
- DOI: 10.1038/s41598-021-97088-8
- **Key Finding:** LULC type has stable influence on PM2.5 concentration
- **PM2.5 Order:** construction lands > unused lands > water > farmlands > grasslands > woodlands
- **Mechanism:** 
  - Construction lands: high population density, traffic flow, industrial activities → highest PM2.5
  - Woodlands: lowest human activities + vegetation negative regulating effect → lowest PM2.5
  - Farmlands: straw burning, fertilizer use, rural heating → moderate PM2.5

## 3. Vegetation/Green Spaces
**Source:** Yao et al. (2023) - Dry deposition effect of urban green spaces on ambient particulate matter pollution in China
- DOI: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165830
- **Key Finding:** Vegetation reduces PM2.5 through dry deposition
- **Mechanism:** 
  - Direct interception and absorption of PM by vegetation through retention, attachment, and adhesion
  - Changing meteorological factors such as wind fields
  - Broad-leaved forests provide main dry deposition effects (89.22%)
- **Model:** UFORE model integrates leaf area, pollutant concentration, wind speed, precipitation

## 4. Topography/DEM (Valley/Basin Effects)
**Source:** Silcox et al. (2012) - Wintertime PM2.5 concentrations during persistent, multi-day cold-air pools in a mountain valley
- DOI: 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.10.041
- **Key Finding:** Valley topography traps cold air and PM2.5 during winter inversions
- **Mechanism:**
  - Cold-air pools (CAPs) form in mountain valleys under high-pressure weather systems
  - Vertical mixing of pollutants is suppressed in stable atmospheric layers
  - PM2.5 concentrations decrease with increasing elevation (up to 30% decrease from 1300 to 1600 m)
  - PM2.5 increases linearly with time during CAP events (~6 µg/m³/day)
- **Quantitative:** PM2.5 can reach 100 µg/m³ during CAP events

## 5. Road Network/Distance to Roadway
**Source:** Mukherjee et al. (2020) - Influence of roadway emissions on near-road PM2.5
- DOI: 10.1016/j.trd.2020.102442
- **Key Finding:** PM2.5 decreases 75% between 5m and 30m from roadway
- **Mechanism:**
  - Motor vehicle emissions contribute PM2.5 through direct emission and precursor gases
  - Traffic mix, volume, vehicle age, speed affect contribution
  - Diesel emissions from heavy-duty vehicles are important component
  - Non-exhaust emissions: brake wear, tire wear, re-suspended road dust
- **Quantitative:** 
  - Annual average PM2.5 increments: 0.1-2.0 µg/m³
  - Traffic contributes 15-35% of PM2.5 in urban areas
  - 20% of US population lives near major roadways

## 6. Industrial Zones
**Source:** Hien et al. (2020) - Hanoi study
- **Key Finding:** Industrial emission hot spots occur in peri-urban areas
- **Mechanism:** Industrial processes, fuel combustion from stationary sources emit PM2.5 and precursors

## Key Causal Mechanisms Summary:

| Factor | Direction | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Population Density | ↑ PM2.5 | More emission sources (traffic, residential, industrial) |
| Construction Land | ↑ PM2.5 | High human activity intensity |
| Vegetation/Forest | ↓ PM2.5 | Dry deposition, interception, absorption |
| Valley Topography | ↑ PM2.5 | Cold-air pool trapping, reduced vertical mixing |
| Distance to Road | ↓ PM2.5 | Dispersion and dilution with distance |
| Industrial Zones | ↑ PM2.5 | Direct emissions from industrial processes |
