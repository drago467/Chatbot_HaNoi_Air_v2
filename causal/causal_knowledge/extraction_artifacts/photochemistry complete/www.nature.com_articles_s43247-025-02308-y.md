Abstract

The hydroxyl radical controls the removal of many trace gases in the atmosphere and initiates the production of secondary pollutants such as ground-level ozone and secondary organic aerosols. An accurate understanding of the chemistry of this radical is important to understand the self-cleansing capability of the atmosphere and to develop effective control strategies. A previous assessment found that in some regions, measurements of the hydroxyl radical were up to ten times greater than predicted, suggesting an unknown chemical mechanism was responsible. However, recent measurements have revealed interferences associated with some instruments. Here we show that accounting for interferences results in measured hydroxyl radical concentrations that agree with model predictions over a wide range of conditions. This suggests that while there may be gaps in our knowledge of this chemistry in some environments, our understanding of hydroxyl radical chemistry and the self-cleansing capability of the atmosphere is better than previously believed.

Introduction

Globally, the hydroxyl radical (OH) is the primary oxidant in the daytime troposphere where it controls the removal of greenhouse gases such as methane and hydrofluorocarbons. In addition to these climate impacts, reactions of OH in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) lead to the production of harmful secondary pollutants such as ozone and secondary organic aerosols (SOA). For these reasons, an accurate representation of OH chemistry in atmospheric models is critical in order to understand the self-cleansing capability of the atmosphere and to develop effective control strategies. Though technically challenging, measurements of OH provide an important test of our understanding of these complex reactions.

Production of OH in the daytime troposphere is primarily driven by photolytic processes such as the photolysis of ozone and subsequent reaction of excited oxygen atoms (O1D) with water vapor, or the photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO) to directly form OH. These photolysis reactions initiate the cycle of reactions shown in Fig. 1, where oxidation of CO and VOCs by OH leads to the formation of peroxy radicals (HO2 and RO2). Propagation reactions with NO convert organic peroxy radicals (RO2) to hydroperoxy radicals (HO2) and an additional reaction with NO converts HO2 to re-form OH. In addition to recycling OH, these propagation reactions simultaneously convert NO to NO2, and subsequent photolysis of NO2 leads to the net production of ozone (Fig. 1). Ozone impacts human health through pulmonary complications and ecosystems through decreased photosynthesis and resiliency1,2.

The sequence of reactions described above and illustrated in Fig. 1 results in a strong correlation between OH concentrations and ozone production that persists across a wide range of NOx concentrations3. The OH radical cycle is terminated by two different types of reactions that are governed by the chemical composition of an environment. The first type of termination mechanism is the reaction of OH and NOx to form nitric acid (HNO3) or nitrous acid (HONO). These reactions typically dominate termination in areas where NOx concentrations from fuel combustion are elevated, such as in urban areas. The second type of termination is reaction between radical species, such as HO2 reacting with HO2 to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or reacting with RO2 to form hydroperoxides (ROOH).

The rates of these radical-radical reactions are most competitive in rural and remote regions where NOx concentrations are low. Overall, at low NOx concentrations, OH is expected to increase with increasing NOx due to enhanced regeneration of OH by NO (the NOx-limited region). At high NOx concentrations, OH is expected to decrease with increasing NOx due to OH radical termination forming nitric acid (the NOx-saturated region). OH concentrations are expected to be the highest at a NOx mixing ratio of a few ppb, separating the two regions (Fig. 2). Given the relationship between ozone production and concentrations of OH, an accurate understanding of this chemistry is critical for predicting ozone production and the self-cleansing capacity of the atmosphere.

In 2014, Rohrer et al. conducted an assessment of OH radical chemistry through comparison of OH concentrations measured by the Laser-Induced Fluorescence – Fluorescence Assay by Gas Expansion (LIF-FAGE) technique from field campaigns in several environments with model predictions4. In this assessment, the individual NOx (as NO2) dependence of the concentration of OH radicals was modeled, and the maximum OH concentration (OHmax) and the corresponding NOx concentration (NO2(OHmax)) were used to normalize the measured and modeled NOx dependence of OH for each campaign (OHnorm = OH/OHmax, NO2,norm = NO2/NO2(OHmax)). This normalization allowed the results from the different campaigns to be compared despite the large differences in ambient conditions.

This assessment concluded that models were generally able to reproduce the measured OH concentrations in urban areas characterized by high NOx emissions (the NOx-saturated region), reflecting that radical propagation through reactions with NO, and radical-NOx termination reactions, are well-understood and accurately represented in models4. However, the assessment also demonstrated that in rural and remote regions, characterized by low concentrations of NOx and high OH reactivity due to high concentrations of biogenic VOCs (BVOCs), models generally underpredicted the measured OH concentrations in the NOx-limited region4. This latter result was in contrast to measurements in areas characterized by lower OH reactivities where the measured OH concentrations tended to follow the expected dependence on nitrogen oxides5,6,7. The authors concluded that an unrecognized regeneration mechanism was responsible for enhancing the concentration of OH radicals at high hydrocarbon reactivity in the NOx-limited regime, maximizing the efficiency of the self-cleansing of the atmosphere by the OH radical4.

However, in contrast to the other rural and remote campaigns analyzed by Rohrer et al.4, the results of the Biosphere Effects on AeRosols and Photochemistry Experiment (BEARPEX) campaign conducted in a California ponderosa pine forest found that the measured OH concentrations agreed with model predictions in a low-NOx environment4,8. During this campaign, chemical modulation tests revealed an unknown interference associated with the LIF-FAGE OH measurement technique8. This result is in contrast to all other campaigns assessed by Rohrer et al. where OH interferences were either not measured or limited to assessments of known interferences with the LIF-FAGE technique9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. This chemical modulation technique is similar to that used for measuring OH radical concentrations using the Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (CIMS) instrumental technique, resulting in measured OH concentrations in the low-NOx regime that are consistent with known chemistry5. Subsequent OH measurements by the LIF-FAGE technique have often implemented similar chemical modulation interference testing8,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25. However, several recent studies have not conducted extensive interference testing, bringing into question the accuracy of the reported OH concentrations and subsequent analyses26,27,28,29,30. Here, a re-assessment of the understanding of OH radical chemistry is presented using new measurements that demonstrate the ability of current models to reproduce the measured OH concentrations and the importance of continuous interference testing in measurements of OH by the LIF-FAGE technique.

Results and Discussion
Implementation of interference testing for OH radical measurements

To attempt to reconcile some of the discrepancies between the measurements and modeled OH concentrations, especially in isoprene-dominated areas, the Leuven Isoprene Mechanism (LIM) and subsequent update (LIM1) were added to the Regional Atmospheric Chemical Mechanism (RACM) and the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) v3.3.1 to include radical recycling in the isoprene oxidation mechanism through peroxy radical isomerization reactions that lead to additional OH and HO2 radical production31,32,33. However, the addition of these schemes was unable to account for the discrepancies34. Furthermore, for models to reproduce measured OH concentrations, the increase in OH production necessary would lead to significantly higher concentrations of HO2 and RO2, which had not been observed8,11,35. These instances of OH model-measurement discrepancies motivated the investigation of an alternative explanation that the OH measurements were impacted by an interference rather than an incomplete chemical mechanism8.

It is known that OH measurements by LIF-FAGE are susceptible to interferences from photolysis of ozone by the laser and subsequent reaction of excited oxygen atoms with water vapor to produce hydroxyl radicals inside the detection cell8,20. While this interference can be characterized and accounted for with measurements of ozone and water vapor concentrations, several LIF instruments have detected interferences that exceed the expected magnitudes from laser-photolysis of ozone8,36. To quantify all interferences that may result in OH production within the LIF detection cell, both the known interference described above and any potential unknown interferences, hexafluoroproprene (C3F6) or propane is added to ambient air before entering the detection cell to remove ambient OH concentrations. A limitation of this technique is the potential scavenging of internally generated OH inside the detection cell by the added C3F6 or propane, which would reduce the ability of this technique to detect interferences. However, laboratory and field measurements as well as theoretical calculations suggest that addition of C3F6 or propane externally to remove ambient OH has a minimal impact on internally generated OH, which can be corrected8,22,26,37,38. Interferences measured during these chemical modulation cycles are subtracted from the total OH measured without chemical modulation to determine the ambient concentration of OH.

Currently, the source of these interferences is not clear. Unknown interferences have been most commonly detected in rural areas under low NOx conditions and where biogenic species are the dominate VOC emission8,18,22,36. However, unknown interferences have also been measured in a tree-filled urban area19. Interferences were detected in both isoprene dominated and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO) dominated environments, suggesting that the interference is not related solely to the chemistry of isoprene or MBO8,18,22. Chamber measurements of isoprene and MBO oxidation did not reveal any interferences with LIF-FAGE measurements of OH, and the radical budgets could be explained by either the known radical sources or model simulations34,39. Previous measurements have found that the interference increases with the concentration of ozone, temperature, and OH reactivity8,22. Some studies have suggested that the decomposition of Criegee intermediates produced from the ozonolysis of biogenic emissions inside the detection cell may be responsible, although the concentration of these intermediates may be too low to explain all of the observed interference in the atmosphere8,40,41,42. Another possible source of the interference is the decomposition of ROOOH molecules produced from the reaction of OH with RO2 radicals43.
