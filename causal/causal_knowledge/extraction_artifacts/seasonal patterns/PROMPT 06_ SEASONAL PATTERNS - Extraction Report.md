# PROMPT 06: SEASONAL PATTERNS - Extraction Report

**Extraction Date:** 2026-01-22  
**Author:** Manus AI  
**Task:** Extract causal relationships about seasonal, diurnal, and event-based patterns affecting PM2.5 in Hanoi/Vietnam/SEA

---

## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of a systematic literature review and causal relationship extraction focused on **seasonal patterns, diurnal cycles, and event-based factors** affecting PM2.5 concentrations in Hanoi, Vietnam, and the broader Southeast Asian region. A total of **35 causal relationships** were extracted from **8 peer-reviewed scientific papers** published between 2002 and 2024.

The analysis reveals five major patterns that govern PM2.5 variability in the region:

1. **Winter Monsoon Pollution Peak** - Northeast monsoon causes 30-40% PM2.5 increases
2. **Bimodal Diurnal Cycle** - Morning and evening peaks driven by traffic and boundary layer dynamics
3. **Harvest Season Burning Events** - Rice straw burning contributes 14-18% of Vietnam's PM2.5
4. **Transboundary Biomass Burning** - Up to 45-68% of PM2.5 in border regions during dry season
5. **Festival Firework Spikes** - Acute PM2.5 spikes up to 383.9 µg/m³ during Tet/New Year

## Key Causal Relationships Extracted

### 1. Seasonal Patterns (17 relationships)

#### Winter Monsoon Effects

The **northeast monsoon** (October-March) is the dominant factor controlling winter PM2.5 levels in Hanoi. Key mechanisms include:

> "During cold surge onsets, long-range transport from China causes an average increase of ∼30% in PM2.5 concentrations." — Phung-Ngoc et al. (2023) [1]

> "The stagnation of local pollution during the cold surges persistence causes an average increase of ∼40% in level of PM2.5." — Phung-Ngoc et al. (2023) [1]

The study identified that **local and non-local sources** contribute differently depending on pollution severity:
- High pollution events: 57% local, 43% non-local
- Lower pollution periods: 42% local, 58% non-local

#### Summer Monsoon Effects

The **southeast monsoon** (May-September) brings cleaner conditions through:
- Increased precipitation and wet deposition
- Higher boundary layer heights
- Stronger vertical mixing

> "The 24-h PM10 concentration varies substantially, from as low as 10 μg m−3 in the rainy monsoon months (June–August) to over 300 μg m−3 in the winter (October–March)." — Hien et al. (2002) [2]

#### Temperature Inversions

Two types of inversions cause pollution episodes:

| Inversion Type | Period | Mechanism | Effect |
|----------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Nocturnal Radiation Inversions (NRIs) | Oct-Dec | Dry air from inland China trajectories | Higher nighttime pollution |
| Subsidence Temperature Inversions (STIs) | Jan-Mar | Moist air from Pacific trajectories | No diurnal variation |

#### Transboundary Biomass Burning

Dry season (January-May) biomass burning in SEA creates significant transboundary pollution:

> "On days when PM2.5 levels were classified as 'Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups' or 'Unhealthy', TB PM2.5 contributed at least 50% to the total PM2.5 at all stations." — Inlaung et al. (2024) [3]

Peak month is **March** with average transboundary PM2.5 reaching 32.91 µg/m³ (46% of total) across Northern Thailand.

### 2. Diurnal Patterns (10 relationships)

Urban PM2.5 exhibits a characteristic **bimodal diurnal pattern**:

| Time | Pattern | Mechanism |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 7:00-8:00 AM | Morning peak | Rush hour traffic + stable morning boundary layer |
| ~12:00 PM | Daily minimum | Maximum boundary layer height + strongest mixing |
| 7:00-11:00 PM | Evening peak (highest) | Boundary layer collapse + evening rush hour |

> "The decreases of boundary layer height and wind speed in the afternoon companying with increased source activity during the afternoon rush hour result in the highest PM2.5 concentration during evening hours." — Zhao et al. (2009) [4]

#### Boundary Layer Dynamics

The **Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL)** is critical to PM2.5 pollution:

> "The PBL is critical to the formation of urban PM2.5 pollution at multiple temporal scales, ranging from diurnal change to seasonal variation." — Miao et al. (2019) [5]

Key PBL-related mechanisms:
- **Aerosol-PBL feedback**: Aerosols heat upper layers, suppress PBL development, worsen pollution
- **Urban Heat Island**: Net increase in aerosol despite enhanced mixing
- **Sea-land breeze**: Recirculation accumulates pollutants in coastal cities

### 3. Event-Based Patterns (6 relationships)

#### Rice Straw Burning

Rice residue burning is a major PM2.5 source in Vietnam:

> "Our results for year 2015 estimate 180 Gg of PM2.5 result from the pile burning method and 130 Gg result from non-pile burning method, with the most-likely current emission scenario of 150 Gg PM2.5 emissions for Vietnam." — Lasko & Vadrevu (2018) [6]

| Burning Practice | Emission Factor | Timing |
|------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Pile burning (hand harvest) | 16.9 g/kg | June, October |
| Non-pile burning (machine harvest) | 8.8 g/kg | June, October |

#### Fireworks (Tet/New Year)

Firework celebrations cause acute PM2.5 spikes:

> "PM2.5 concentrations peaking at 383.9 µg m−3... Total (>0.056 µm) water-soluble bulk particle mass concentrations were enriched by 5.7 times during the fireworks relative to the background." — Lorenzo et al. (2021) [7]

Effects persist for hours after the event, with elevated accumulation-mode particles maintained for up to 3 hours.

### 4. Meteorological Factors (3 relationships)

Key meteorological determinants of PM2.5:

| Factor | Relationship | Importance |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Wind speed | Inverse | Most important determinant |
| Air temperature | Complex | Second most important |
| Rainfall | Inverse | Controls coarse PM through wet deposition |
| Relative humidity | Variable | Affects particle hygroscopicity |

> "Meteorological parameters could explain from 60% to 74% of the day-to-day variations of particulate concentrations." — Hien et al. (2002) [2]

## Key Insights for PM2.5 Forecasting

Based on the extracted relationships, the following factors should be prioritized in PM2.5 forecasting models for Hanoi/Vietnam:

### High-Priority Predictors

1. **Monsoon phase** (NE vs SE monsoon)
2. **Cold surge events** (onset, persistence, retreat phases)
3. **Boundary layer height** (diurnal and seasonal)
4. **Wind speed and direction**
5. **Fire hotspot data** (MODIS/VIIRS for biomass burning)

### Event-Based Alerts

1. **Rice harvest seasons** (June, October)
2. **Tet/New Year celebrations** (fireworks)
3. **El Niño episodes** (amplifies dry season severity)
4. **Cold surge forecasts** (3-5 day lead time)

### Temporal Considerations

| Timescale | Key Factors |
|-----------|-------------|
| Hourly | Traffic patterns, boundary layer evolution |
| Daily | Meteorological conditions, local emissions |
| Seasonal | Monsoon phase, biomass burning season |
| Interannual | ENSO, economic development trends |
