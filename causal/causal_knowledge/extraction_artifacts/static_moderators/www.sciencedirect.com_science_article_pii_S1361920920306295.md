In order to represent multiple explanatory variables at once, a GAM was used to predict the near-road IDW increment using distance to road, percent of time a site was upwind, and FE–AADT (the top three factors from Table 2). The model was run to optimize the restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML), and each of the three predictor variables was given three degrees of freedom. The p value, and relative variable importance of these three variables are presented in Table 4. The model had an overall adjusted R2 value of 0.63, predicting the majority of the variability in the IDW increment. Distance to road was the variable with the highest relative importance and had the lowest p value, whereas percent of time the monitor was upwind and FE–AADT had a similar relative variable importance, about 20% of the distance to road. Overall, the regression models shown in Fig. 5, the correlations shown in Table 3, and the GAM model show a statistically significant correlation between distance to road and the increment, and also show a modest correlation between FE–AADT and percentage of time a site was upwind with the increment, which was statistically significant in the pairwise comparison case.

4. Implications for POAQC screening
Under transportation conformity, interagency consultation partners weigh proposed transportation projects on a case-by-case basis and assess whether a project is a POAQC requiring quantitative PM2.5 hot-spot assessment. PM2.5 conditions are dynamic in metropolitan areas—the vehicle fleet becomes cleaner each year as older, higher-polluting vehicles are replaced by vehicles meeting more stringent emissions standards, and regional air quality conditions generally improve over time. EPA, for example, documents a 41% decrease in PM2.5 concentrations nationally from 2000 to 2017 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2020). Section 93.123(b)(1)(i) requires PM2.5 hot-spot analyses to be completed for “New highway projects that have a significant number of diesel vehicles, and expanded projects that have a significant increase in the number of diesel vehicles.” In the context of changing fleet emissions and regional air quality, interagency consultation partners must dynamically assess factors that lead to a POAQC determination, including the significance of diesel vehicle traffic under present and forecast scenarios. This discussion illustrates how quantitative data from this study can be used to inform POAQC determinations.
The upper bound of the 2017 PM2.5 increment was 2.0 ± 0.2 µg/m3 for the focused case of 20 near-road sites, where the sites with possible confounding factors have been removed. The upper bound of the increment for near-road sites with monitors sited 10 m or more from the roadway was 1.4 ± 0.2 µg/m3. The implications for designating proposed roadway projects as POAQC are shown in Section 4.1, followed in Section 4.2 by the forecasts of the upper bound of traffic-related PM2.5 for the coming decades using projected changes in emissions.
4.1. The current influence of traffic emissions on annual average PM2.5
The near-road sites represent a wide range of highway environments, with substantial variability in traffic volume, fleet mix, meteorology, and other environmental conditions shown in Table 1. For the set of 20 near-road sites, the monitor distance to the road ranged from 5 to 33 m from the roadway. As shown in Table 1, average wind speed ranges from 0.24 m/s to 3.11 m/s, and the percent of hours upwind ranged from 13.5% to 46.5%. AADT ranged from ~68,000 to ~320,000; FE-AADT ranged from ~129,000 to ~ 624,000; and estimated number of HDDVs ranged from 0 to 47,445. Long Beach-4008, the site with the highest estimated number of HDDVs, had an increment of 2.0 ± 0.3, which is equivalent to the upper bound from Providence-0030. About half of the sites (11 out of 20) had more than 10,000 HDDVs. The roadway geometry within 1 km of these sites showed wide variety, with numerous sites stationed at curved roadways and within 500 m of a major interchange. The immediate environment of the near-road sites was also diverse, including dividers, complex lane structures, and other structures of the built environment at many sites. Considering all of these factors, the increments represent traffic-related PM2.5 over a wide range of highway project conditions. These findings provide the following insights, which can inform POAQC determinations. These insights are applicable to transportation project situations covered by the data set evaluated here (see Table 1).
•
Proposed highway projects for sites where the current (i.e., 2017) ambient air quality (i.e., background concentration) has an annual average PM2.5 level of at least 2.0 ± 0.2 µg/m3 below the NAAQS value (currently set at 12 µg/m3) should not expect to see air quality impacts that result in an average annual PM2.5 concentration above the NAAQS.
•
Proposed highway projects where the only receptors of concern are beyond 10 m of the roadway, and where the current annual average PM2.5 level is at least 1.4 ± 0.2 µg/m3 below the NAAQS value, should not expect to see air quality impacts that result in an average annual PM2.5 above the NAAQS.
Given the statistical relationships demonstrated in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 it is clear that distance to road, the percent of time the near-road site is upwind of the road, and FE-AADT are key factors influencing the increment. These relationships were shown in Fig. 5. The interagency consultation process can weigh how specific project conditions relate to the variables shown in Fig. 5 and can consider these relationships in the context of POAQC determination. For example, based on the 20 site case, the PM2.5 increment is estimated to fall ~ 50% between 10  m and 30 m from the roadway (Fig. 5c).
4.2. Projecting the impact of emission changes over time
The results from the near-road monitoring sites, showing the range of traffic-related PM2.5 impacts, can be synthesized with our understanding of the projected change of vehicle emissions in the coming decades. First, we examine the relative contribution of exhaust and non-exhaust emissions to traffic-related PM2.5. Second, we forecast how the exhaust emissions of PM2.5 will change over time with fleet turnover. Third, we use these findings to forecast how the increments identified in Section 3 will change in the coming decades.
4.2.1. The contribution of exhaust emissions to traffic-related PM2.5
Traffic-related PM2.5 emissions come from three sources: exhaust, re-suspended road dust, and brake and tire wear. Table 5 shows results from three analyses about the relative contributions of PM2.5 emissions from these sources. The contribution from surface wear is incorporated into the re-suspended road dust category. Companion work by the study team used the MOVES and AERMOD models to estimate site-specific emissions for two cases Craig et al., 2020. For the case of Providence-0030, a target roadway with 186,300 AADT and 13.7% HDDV, the exhaust was found to contribute to 49% of traffic PM2.5 emissions in 2015 and 2016. For the case of Indianapolis-0087, a target roadway with 189,760 AADT and 10.1% HDDV, the exhaust was found to contribute to 40% of traffic PM2.5 emissions in 2016. A study by Jeong et al. (2019) examined the traffic emissions of a roadway in Toronto in 2016 with 400,000 AADT, using the chemical composition of PM2.5 and source apportionment. They found that exhaust contributed to 65% of traffic-related PM2.5 emissions, with a strong dependence on HDDV fraction (approximately 6–13% of the fleet mix). For comparison, a review article examining studies from roadways around the world found that exhaust emissions contributed to the majority of overall traffic PM2.5 emissions in most of the published studies reviewed (Pant and Harrison, 2013).

4.2.2. Projections of exhaust emissions from 2017 to 2040
The projected exhaust emissions for U.S. vehicle fleets for the calendar years 2017 to 2040 are shown in Table 6. Emissions in grams per mile per average vehicle are shown for HDDVs, light-duty vehicles (LDVs), and an average vehicle in a vehicle fleet composed of 8% HDDVs and 92% LDVs. The 8% HDDV case is a weighted average using 8% HDDV emission rate and 92% LDV emission rate. National average emission estimates are presented using the MOVES 2014 model developed by the EPA, and for San Francisco using the EMFAC2017 model, developed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The percent change of the emissions reductions relative to the year 2017 are shown in the last six columns of Table 6. A decrease of exhaust emissions is shown in all cases for both vehicle types, due to fleet turnover. For example, the exhaust emissions of a roadway with 8% HDDV in San Francisco are projected to decrease by 88% by 2040 using EMFAC, assuming constant AADT and a constant HDDV fraction of 8%. The specific change in exhaust emissions for a given roadway will depend on changes in the regional vehicle fleet and traffic activity over time.

Table 6. Projected exhaust-only PM2.5 emissions of vehicles for the calendar years 2017–2040 for six cases. For the six columns to the left, emissions are shown in grams per mile per average vehicle, for HDDV, LDV, and a fleet mix with 8% HDDV and 92% LDV. Emissions are shown for a national average modeled using MOVES, and for San Francisco using EMFAC. For the six columns to the right, the same emissions are shown relative to the baseline year of 2017.

4.2.3. Projected traffic contribution to PM2.5
The upper bound of traffic-related PM2.5 represented by the increment for near-road sites in 2017 can be combined with the projected change in exhaust emissions (Table 6) and an assumed fraction of traffic-related PM2.5 due to exhaust, to forecast the upper bound of traffic-related PM2.5 in the coming decades. In 2017, the upper bound of the observed annual average PM2.5 traffic impact was 2.0 ± 0.2 µg/m3, with an upper bound of 1.4 ± 0.2 µg/m3, for sites with monitors 10 m or more from the roadway. Using the example based on the modeled Indianapolis-0087 study, which is the most conservative assumption out of the three cases in Table 5, we can take the fraction of 40% to illustrate a lower end estimate of the contribution of exhaust emissions to total traffic-related emissions. The change in the PM2.5 traffic impact for a given project can then be calculated using the equation:

The projected change of the PM2.5 increment is illustrated in the following examples. These examples are based on the formulas above, use the MOVES national average emissions estimate, and assume a project with constant vehicle speeds and an HDDV fraction of 8% for all years. The exhaust emissions are projected to be 42% of 2017 emissions by 2025 and 20% of 2017 emissions by 2040 (see Table 6). Using the equations above, the PM2.5 impact of a highway would fall from 2.0 ± 0.2 µg/m3 in 2017 to 1.6 ± 0.2 µg/m3 by 2025, and to 1.4 ± 0.2 µg/m3 by 2040, if AADT, fleet mix, and vehicle speeds remain constant. Following the same method, for the domain greater than or equal to 10 m from the roadway, the PM2.5 impact of a highway would fall from 1.4 ± 0.2 µg/m3 in 2017 to 1.1 ± 0.2 µg/m3 by 2025 and 1.0 ± 0.2 µg/m3 by 2040. This procedure only accounts for changing exhaust emissions caused by fleet turnover, and does not account for the full range of factors in forecasting incremental PM2.5 impacts that may be considered during interagency consultation. Other factors which may influence incremental PM2.5 that are not evaluated in this study include the trend toward heavier vehicles, leading to greater non-exhaust traffic emissions, and the trend toward more hybrid and electric vehicles leading to lower traffic emissions (Timmers and Achten, 2016).
The near-road PM2.5 increment will vary year by year for any given site, due to changes in traffic emissions, meteorology, and other site-specific factors such as local-scale non-traffic emissions. Non-traffic emissions are a confounding factor on the true near-road increment. As shown in Section 4.2, national average exhaust emissions are forecast to decrease over 50% by 2025 (see case 3 in Table 6). Fig. 4 shows that only three out of 20 near-road sites in the focused case had PM2.5 increments greater than 1.5 μg/m3. Year-to-year meteorological variations will impact the absolute concentrations, but since regional-scale changes in factors such precipitation and wind speed would be relatively consistent across an urban area, such conditions should similarly affect near-road and nearby monitoring sites. Thus, for transportation project situations covered by the data set evaluated here (see Table 1), the value of 2.0 ± 0.2 µg/m3 is a reasonable representation of an upper bound roadway impact, particularly in light of expected emissions reductions due to fleet turnover in the coming decades.
