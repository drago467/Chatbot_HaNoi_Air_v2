Effect of the LULC type on PM2.5

To further investigate the relationship between the PM2.5 dynamics and the different LULC types, a spatial analyze based on ArcGIS was conducted. The results (Table 2) show that, for all LULC types, the mean PM2.5 concentrations significantly increased from 2000 to 2018. Among them, unused lands had the largest increase. Woodlands and grasslands had the largest increasing rates, 86.02% and 81.00%, respectively. Construction lands had the lowest increasing rate of 20.92%. The rates of increase of other the LULC types were relatively close, with a scope of 38.45% and 47.99%. The increasing trends indicate that the PM2.5 pollution situation worsened during the study period. The standard deviations (SDs) all increased, meaning that the spatial difference of PM2.5 pollution was increased. Indeed, the whole study area is faced with a seriously PM2.5 polluted situation.

Furthermore, for the different LULC types, in 2000, woodlands had the lowest mean PM2.5 concentration, although that of the grasslands was very similar. Construction lands had the highest mean PM2.5 concentration. In 2018, the mean PM2.5 concentrations of the woodlands and grasslands were still very close, and were still the lowest values. The PM2.5 concentration of the construction lands was still the highest. In both 2 years, the order of PM2.5 concentration for the different LULC types was the same: construction lands > unused lands > water > farmlands > grasslands > woodlands, meaning that the LULC type had an important influence on the PM2.5 concentrations.

As showed in Table 3, in 2000, the main land type in Shanxi Province was farmland, whose area was 6.12 × 104 km2, accounting for 39.09% of the total area. Next in total area were grasslands and woodlands, accounting for 29.16% and 28.01% respectively. Construction lands covered 0.42 × 104 km2, accounting for 2.67% of the total area. The areas of water and unused lands were very little, accounting for just 0.97% and 0.10% respectively. In 2018, although farmlands still covered the largest area, its area reduced to 5.78 × 104 km2, accounting for 36.91% of the total area. The area of woodlands increased, accounting for 28.36% of the total area, and became the second largest land type. The area of grasslands decreased by 0.16 × 104 km2 and became the third largest land type. The area of construction lands increased dramatically, and its proportion increased to 5.56%, which was two times greater than in 2000. Water and unused lands still covered very little area, accounting for 0.94% and 0.08% of the total, respectively.

From the perspective of land being converting from one type to another, there was a large conversion of farmlands to other land types, roughly 2.29 × 104 km2. Grasslands, woodlands, and construction lands underwent the largest amounts of change, accounting for 53.47%, 23.07%, and 20.91% of the total converted area, respectively. On the other hand, the other land types that were converted to farmlands accounted for 1.95 × 104 km2, which significant decreased the total area of farmlands. The main conversion types of woodlands to other land types were grasslands, farmlands and construction lands. The sources of woodlands were mainly grasslands and farmlands. It was seen that the amount of woodlands converted to other types, and those converted to woodlands, were nearly equivalent in total area. Grasslands showed a similar trend as seen for the woodlands, which also showed a relatively stable state. Construction lands were mainly converted to farmlands, which accounted for 82.51% of the total converted area. The total area of construction lands that were converted to other types was 0.22 × 104 km2. The main conversion sources of construction lands were farmlands, grasslands, and woodlands, and the total conversion area was 0.67 × 104 km2, which was caused by fast urbanization.

PM2.5 dynamics

As water and unused lands covered only 1% of the total area, we only considered the other four land types (farmlands, woodlands, grasslands, and construction lands) to ascertain the influence of the LULCC types on the PM2.5 dynamics. As discussed above, the PM2.5 concentrations considerably increased from 2000 to 2018 for all land types, which indicated that there would be a PM2.5 concentration increase for non-LULCC areas. The increase was mainly caused by increased pollution levels, not by LULCC. This would bring disturbance to our analysis. To avoid this disturbance, the range of PM2.5 concentration variations in non-LULCC areas was calculated first (Table 4) and set as the reference variation range when analyzing the PM2.5 concentration variations in the LULCC areas.

Full size table

As showed in Table 4, the PM2.5 dynamics in the different LULCC types showed two opposing trends, increasing and decreasing. The largest increase was for woodlands converted to construction lands, while the largest decline was for farmlands converted to woodlands. When farmlands were converted to woodlands and grasslands, the PM2.5 concentrations declined, but when they were converted to construction lands, the PM2.5 concentration increased. Increasing trends were seen when woodlands were converted to the other three land types. Conversely, declining trends were found when construction lands were converted to the other land types. When grasslands were converted to woodlands, a declining trend was witnessed, but when they were converted to the other two land types, increasing trends were seen.

As discussed above, the PM2.5 concentrations for the four land types showed similar trends in both years: construction lands > farmlands > grasslands > woodlands. Therefore, according to the PM2.5 concentrations, the four land types were divide into four grades: highest (construction lands), high (farmlands), medium (grasslands) and low (woodlands). As showed in Table 5, when high-grade land types are converted to low-grade types, the PM2.5 concentrations decrease, and when low-grade land types are converted to high-grade types, the PM2.5 concentrations increase.

Discussion

As an important energy base, the economic development of Shanxi Province has been mainly based on energy consumption, which continues to generate large quantities of harmful emissions45. Therefore, human activities were considered as the most important influence factor of PM2.5 pollution11. However, LULC types were also representative of different human activities46. Different to previous studies, which mainly focused on discussing the relationship between land use type and PM2.5 concentrations at urban scales37,47, in this study we discussed the impact of land use on PM2.5 concentrations from two aspects: different LULC and LULCC types at regional scales.

The different LULC types indicated the different intensities of human activities. Construction lands represented the highest intensity because of the high population density, traffic flow, industrial and commercial activities, etc., therein. All of these generate large quantities of air pollutants and caused the highest PM2.5 concentrations48. Farmlands were also intensively affected by human activities, which caused relatively high PM2.5 concentrations. Firstly, straw burning in farmlands can result in a sharp increase of PM2.5 concentration within a short time49. Secondly, as a great agricultural country, the use of fertilizer in China is pervasive, and emissions arising from the manufacturing and use of fertilizer have a strong relationship with PM2.550. For example, fertilizer liberated from the soil can be converted into a precursor of PM2.551. Thirdly, heating activities in rural areas in winter mainly consist of burning coal, which generates large quantities of air pollutants and has an important impact on the PM2.5 concentration in farmlands52,53. Vegetation covered area, including woodlands and grasslands, had relatively low PM2.5 concentrations. These areas were less influenced by human activities, as indicated by the lower pollutant emissions therein. Meanwhile, it has been suggested that vegetation coverage has a negative regulating effect on PM2.5 concentration54,55. Thus, woodlands have the lowest PM2.5 concentrations because of their highest vegetation coverage.

The different LULCC types represented transitions among the different intensities of human activities, which caused dynamic changes of the PM2.5 concentrations. When other land types were converted to construction lands, the intensity of human activities increased, which caused an increase of PM2.5 concentration. A similar conclusion was found in another study, which showed that when natural land cover is replaced by manmade areas PM2.5 concentrations increase56. Furthermore, other LULCC types were also discussed in our study. Farmlands may also contain intense human activities that can increase the PM2.5 concentration, such as agricultural activities57,58. This was demonstrated by the increasing trend of PM2.5 concentration when woodlands and grasslands were converted to farmlands. As vegetation coverage had a negative effect on PM2.5 concentration55, the PM2.5 concentration also changed when the vegetation type changed; i.e. an increase trend was seen when woodlands were converted to grasslands.

Due to the limited LULC data, this study illustrated the influence of LULC and LULCC on PM2.5 at the regional scale where human activities were considered as the most important influence factor. However, PM2.5 pollution is both affected by human and natural factors59. In desert areas, natural factors including dust and wind could be the most important factors60, while in coastal areas, climatic elements had the most important influence on PM2.5 pollution37. These situations were not discussed in the present study. Future studies at larger scales are required to demonstrate the influence of LULC on PM2.5 more comprehensively. The relationship between PM2.5 pollution and its influence factors is complex and non-linear61. Traditional linear analysis methods have certain limitations and new non-linear analysis methods should be employed. Moreover, higher spatial and temporal resolution PM2.5 data and LULC data are also required to better understand the response mechanism of PM2.5 pollution to LULCC.

Conclusions

In this study, high-accuracy PM2.5 data from ACAG and LULC data were employed to explore the relationship between PM2.5 and LULCC. A GWR method was used for the general analysis, and a spatial analysis method based on the geographic information system was used for the detailed analysis. The main conclusions can be drawn as follows:

(1)

The GWR analysis showed that R2 reached 0.92, which represented a stable relationship between PM2.5 and LULCC. High local R2 values located in highly dynamic LULCC areas indicated that the dynamic PM2.5 had a significant response to LULCC.

(2)

In both considered years, 2000 and 2018, the order of PM2.5 concentration in the different LULC types was the same: construction lands > unused lands > water > farmlands >grasslands > woodlands, meaning that the LULC type had an important influence on the PM2.5 concentration.

(3)

LULCC can also impact the dynamics of PM2.5 concentration. When low-grade land types are converted to high-grade types, the PM2.5 concentration increases; otherwise, it decreases. From another angle, when natural lands are converted to human-related lands, the PM2.5 concentration increase; otherwise, the PM2.5 concentrations decrease.
