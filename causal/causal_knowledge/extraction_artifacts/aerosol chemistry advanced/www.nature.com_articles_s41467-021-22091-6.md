Abstract

The formation mechanism of aerosol sulfate during wintertime haze events in China is still largely unknown. As companions, SO2 and transition metals are mainly emitted from coal combustion. Here, we argue that the transition metal-catalyzed oxidation of SO2 on aerosol surfaces could be the dominant sulfate formation pathway and investigate this hypothesis by integrating chamber experiments, numerical simulations and in-field observations. Our analysis shows that the contribution of the manganese-catalyzed oxidation of SO2 on aerosol surfaces is approximately one to two orders of magnitude larger than previously known routes, and contributes 69.2% ± 5.0% of the particulate sulfur production during haze events. This formation pathway could explain the missing source of sulfate and improve the understanding of atmospheric chemistry and climate change.

Introduction

As an important component of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfate exerts a significant influence on the Earth’s climate system, air quality, and public health1,2,3. In recent years, severe haze episodes characterized by high sulfate concentrations have occurred frequently in northern China4. Hourly sulfate concentrations typically exceed 100 μg/m3 during wintertime haze events5. Traditionally, sulfate formation mechanisms primarily include the gas phase oxidation of SO2 by OH radicals and the aqueous oxidation of S(IV) by H2O2, O3, organic peroxides, and O2 catalyzed by transition metal ions (TMIs), e.g., Fe(III) and Mn(II), in cloud/fog water droplets6. The large gap between observed and simulated sulfate concentrations during haze events, however, indicates the existence of unknown pathways for sulfate production5,7.

Recently, several chemical mechanisms for sulfate production have been proposed and highlighted, mainly occurring in the aerosol liquid water. Cheng et al.8 suggested that the S(IV) could be oxidized by NO2 in aerosol water, and Liu et al.9 proposed that the oxidation of S(IV) by H2O2 in aerosol water considering the ionic strength effect could be an important pathway. Besides, Song et al.10 suggested that the hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) produced from the reaction of S(IV) with HCHO in aerosol water may explain the observed high levels of particulate sulfur.

Constrains exist in the above aqueous reaction routes, however. First, the aerosol water content (AWC) usually ranges from tens to hundreds of micrograms per cubic meter in heavy hazes, which is still multiple orders of magnitude less than the cloud water content (0.05–3 g m−3)6. The space for aqueous reactions is too small to produce sulfate. Second, the aerosol water is often more acidic, with pH values ranging from ~4 to 5 in heavy hazes11,12,13, which limits the dissolution of SO2. Third, these reactions consume a large amount of photochemical oxidants when generating sulfate, but the oxidant amounts are not always sufficient in heavy hazes14,15.

Xue et al.16 and Wang et al.17 suggested that reactions in cloud/fog water might contribute significantly to sulfate production. However, fog does not occur in most haze events18,19. Additionally, haze events often occur during stagnant weather conditions with stable stratification and weak turbulent diffusion20,21. Consequently, it is difficult to transport near surface precursors upward to high altitudes, and the sulfate generated in high-altitude clouds is also difficult to transport downward to the near surface. Therefore, in-cloud reactions could not account for sulfate formation during haze events. Indeed, numerical simulations have not indicated that the aqueous oxidation in cloud/fog water is an important pathway during haze events5,7.

China is the country with the world’s largest coal consumption, averaging approximately three billion tons of coal annually in recent years22, and contributing nearly 80% of the national SO2 emission23. As companion emitters, atmospheric heavy metals (including TMIs) from coal combustion are present in much higher concentrations in northern China than in developed countries24,25,26. Traditionally, S(IV) could be oxidized by TMIs in cloud/fog water27,28.

In this work, we show that the manganese-catalyzed oxidation of SO2 on aerosol surfaces dominates sulfate formation during haze events. The mechanism is identified via chamber experiments, and the sulfate formation rate of this mechanism is approximately one to two orders of magnitude larger than previously known routes. In-field observations show similar temporal variations, size distributions and internal mixing state of Mn and sulfate. Furthermore, chemical transport model simulations show that the manganese-catalyzed oxidation of SO2 on aerosol surfaces dominates sulfate formation and contributes 92.5 ± 3.9% of the sulfate (69.2 ± 5.0% of the particulate sulfur) production during haze events.

Results and discussion
Laboratory studies

The SO2 oxidation experiments were performed in a temperature and humidity-controlled chamber, which is described in detail in the “Methods” section (Supplementary Fig. 1)29. Size-selected particles (ammonium sulfate or sodium chloride) with different aerosol phase concentrations of Mn2+ were added to the chamber along with various mixing ratios of SO2 and NH3. The rapid growth of both particle mass concentration and diameter were observed in the presence of Mn2+ at 298 K (Fig. 1a), especially with sodium chloride seed particles. There was no apparent sulfate formation in the absence of any one of these factors, however, including O2, aerosol phase Mn2+, and aerosol liquid water (Supplementary Fig. 2). In addition, this reaction was found to be inhibited by more acidic seed particles (ammonium sulfate) and a lower concentration of NH3, suggesting that pH could be another critical factor for sulfate formation. The calculated sulfate formation rate ranged from 14.1 to 24.5 μg m−3 h−1, while the mean diameter of seed particles could increase from ~60 to 82–105 nm within 50 min. This phenomenon could not be explained by the Mn2+ aqueous catalysis pathway based on model calculation, even without considering the ionic strength inhibition effect (Fig. 1a). The sulfate formation rate via the aqueous route is approximately several orders of magnitude lower than the observed formation rate6. Harris et al.30 also detected an unexpected rapid SO2 oxidation rate in a dust leachate, which contained a mixture of TMI (Fe, Ti, Mn, and Cr) rather than the iron-only catalytic pathway. In our study, compared to the Mn-catalytic reaction, there was no noticeable sulfate formation observed through the Fe-catalytic pathway in the chamber experiment (Supplementary Fig. 3), and the reaction rate of the Fe–Mn-catalytic reaction did not show any synergism enhancement effect. This evidence indicated that the role of individual TMIs or their composite effect to sulfate formation need further reinvestigation under close to real atmosphere conditions. The heterogeneous reaction on the aerosol surface probably plays a vital role in this process.

To further evaluate the role of SO2 and Mn2+, chamber experiments were carried out with different concentrations of Mn2+ and SO2 under similar relative humidity (RH) and NH3 conditions. As shown in Fig. 1b, the measured sulfate formation rates varied linearly with the concentrations of Mn2+ and SO2, suggesting the first-order reaction of both SO2 and Mn2+. A transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDX) was utilized to analyze the single-particle morphology and chemical composition at the micro-level (Fig. 1c). Most of the particles containing Mn generated a much larger size (a minimum of 100 nm) during chamber reactions (Supplementary Table 1) compared to the initial produced seed particle size (50 nm). N and S elements observed at the same location indicated the formation of ammonium sulfate. The particle morphology and elemental distributions of S, Mn, and N confirmed that ammonia sulfate formation was present Mn-catalytic reaction.

In the Mn2+ catalytic aqueous phase reaction, Tursic et al.31 found that substituting NaCl for NaNO3 as the seed material could lead to a faster reaction under acidic (pH = 3) and dark conditions due to the formation of Cl2– radical ions. Moreover, Harris et al.32 found that SO2 was rapidly oxidized on the NaOCl aerosol which produced HOCl in solution. To examine whether the simultaneous presence of Mn2+, O2, and Cl– in aerosol liquid water would facilitate HOCl formation, chamber experiments were also conducted under the NaNO3 seed condition. As depicted in Supplementary Fig. 4, there was no clear reaction rate decrease in the NaNO3 seed reaction.

The sulfate formation route via the Mn-catalytic reaction pathway that was found in the chamber experiments should be distinguished from the traditional aqueous routes. Therefore, in situ chemical composition measurements in single droplets using a confocal Raman microscope were performed to further evaluate this mechanism (Supplementary Fig. 5). Supplementary Fig. 7 presents the Raman spectrum changes of the ammonium chloride and manganese chloride mixture in a droplet exposing to SO2 and zero air, in which a noticeable increase in the peak intensity of sulfate was observed with increasing exposure time. As depicted in Fig. 2, parallel experiments were performed on droplets with diameters ranging from 5 to 50 μm. The sulfate peak area ratio A(SO42−)/A(H2O) with standard solution calibration, representing the sulfate content of these three sets of experiments, exhibited a distinct increasing trend. The sulfate production rate increased with decreasing droplet diameter, revealing that the reaction rates were correlated with the surface-area-to-volume ratio, consistent with the heterogeneous reaction process33. These results verified the important role of the aerosol surface in sulfate formation during the chamber experiments.

The chamber experiments were carried out in a wide range of temperatures, from 298 to 278 K to study the temperature dependence of sulfate production rates. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, in high RH (>84%) conditions, the sulfate production rate decreased with decreasing temperature. This phenomenon is consistent with an exothermic reaction. The sulfate formation reaction would tend to acidify the aerosols, and NH3 would inhibit the hydrolysis of ammonium, thus influencing the H+ concentration in the aerosol phase. Consequently, the sulfate production rate was negatively correlated with H+ concentration which was fitted in the form f(H+), as shown in Fig. 3a and Eq. (5) (“Method” section). The pH was calculated using the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model IV34. We further investigated the influences of ionic strength on sulfate formation at 298 K (Fig. 3b). Unlike the restraints of TMI-catalyzed aqueous phase reactions under high ionic strength condition9,35, there was no apparent decrease with increasing ionic strength, contrast to the ion–ion aqueous phase reaction mechanism. Meanwhile, under low-temperature conditions (278 and 283 K), accelerated sulfate formation rates were observed when the RH was lower than 84% and 82%, respectively. The enhancement factors were ~10.0 ± 1.5 (278 K) and 10.6 ± 0.11 (283 K) when the aerosol ionic strength exceeded 14.2 and 15.3 mol l−1, respectively. These thresholds were positively correlated with temperature, and the sulfate formation enhancement factors were similar (Fig. 3b). In addition, the experimental investigation of the NO2 and O3 pathways under low-temperature and high-ionic strength conditions revealed no apparent formation of sulfate (Supplementary Fig. 8). The sulfate formation rate was no more than the room temperature aqueous phase reaction rate, and the ionic strength effect on the NO2 pathway was almost negligible.
