Highlights
•
Dry deposition and vegetation collections are used to represent the PM removal.
•
Forests are more efficient than wetlands and lakes in PM pollution removal.
•
Fine particles deposited most in winter while the coarse particles were in spring.
•
The PM removal due to vegetation was lower than 1%.
Abstract
The dry deposition of particular matters from atmosphere to ecosystems is an undesirable consequence of this pollution while the deposition process is also influenced by different land use types. In current study, concentration of fine particles, coarse particles and meteorological data were collected during the daytime in an artificial forest, wetland and a water surface in the Beijing Olympic Park. Dry deposition velocity, fluxes and vegetation collection were calculated by different models and the results were compared. The results show: (1) the deposition velocity onto the forest canopy was higher than which onto the wetland and the water surface and the velocity varied in different seasons; (2) the fine particles deposited most in the winter while the coarse particles was in the spring; (3) the vegetation collection rates of fine particles were lower than coarse particles, and the forest collected more PMs than the wetland plants.
Introduction
PM10 and PM2.5 refer to particulate matters (PMs) having an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 μm and 2.5 μm, respectively (Beckett et al., 1998). These PMs mainly originate from vehicle exhaust, road dust, and industrial production (Dzierzanowski et al., 2011). With rapid urbanization and industrialization in China, in particular in major cities such as Beijing, PM pollution is increasing in severity. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, in the first six-month period of 2012, the average concentration of PM10 in Beijing was 124 μg/m3, whereas, according to the European Council Directive 1999/30/EC, the annual average concentration of PM10 should not exceed 40 μg/m3 (Directive, 1999). These PMs consist of inhalable particles, and PM2.5 in particular is harmful to health because of the highly toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and other toxic materials it contains (Jouraeva et al., 2002). The Chinese government reported that in 2010, more than 7700 people died from diseases caused by inhalable particles in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Xian, with the number rising to 8500 in 2012. PM pollution must therefore be controlled.
Forests are effective for absorbing and filtering PM (Draaijers et al., 1994, Escobedo and Nowak, 2009; Ji and Zhao, 2014, Liu et al., 2015, Nowak et al., 2006, Slinn, 1982, Terzaghi, 2013, Yang et al., 2005), and the forest canopy can increase PM dry deposition by leading air movement (Giorgi, 1986). A study in England showed that the concentration of inhalable particles in the West Midlands was reduced by 10% and that 10 t PM10 settled every year as the urban forest coverage increased from 3.7% to 16.5% and that the amount settled would be 200 t per year if the coverage increased to 54% (McDonald 2007). Fifty percent of PMs produced by the open cast mining process could be reduced by a 15 km wide birch forest (Sharma and Roy, 1997). In the Chicago, USA, 234 t of PM10 can be annually removed when the urban forest coverage increases to 11%. The urban forest in the city of Sacramento also removes 2.7 t PM10 daily (Nowak et al., 2006). In Mexico, the forests in media areas can remove 100 t PM10 from the air every year, amounting to 2% of annual emissions in that country (Baumgardner et al., 2012). In addition, deposition to the forest and the particle attenuation processes are influenced by attributes of the forest, such as canopy density and plant species, and relatively sparse forests were shown to be more efficient in PM deposition (Popek, 2013, Shan, 2007, Sæbø, 2012, Terzaghi, 2013, Tiwary et al., 2008). Another research in Beijing shows shorter tree-building distance and canopy–canopy distance in urban area can reduce both outdoor and even indoor PM concentrations more efficient (Ji and Zhao, 2014). Deposition of PM is also influenced by meteorological factors, especially wind speed, humidity, and temperature (Croxford et al., 1996, Erisman and Draaijers, 2003, Ould-Dada, 2002). Water surface in a city can change the microclimate by increasing humidity and decreasing temperature. Thus, lakes and rivers in a city can also theoretically influence PM dry deposition. However, there have been few studies of dry deposition to lakes. In China, some studies showed that the concentration of PM2.5 over Hengshui Lake is lower than that over an adjacent city at the same height, but there was no further analysis of the deposition process.
In order to estimate the dry deposition on a forest, wetland and lake in Beijing to help the government monitor the severe PM pollution in this area, we recorded PM concentrations, meteorological conditions, and canopy density every month from April 2013 to March 2014 to estimate the settlement in an artificial forest and over a lake. The aims of this study were to (1) calculate and compare dry deposition velocities onto three land surfaces (a forest, wetland and lake) in four seasons during the daytime; (2) calculate and compare the dry deposition fluxes onto three land use types in different seasons; and (3) calculate and compare the vegetation collection abilities in forest and wetland.

Experimental sites
As shown in Fig. 1, the experimental sites were located at an artificial lake and a forest in the Beijing Olympic Forest Park, which is adjacent to the 5th Ring Road. The site in the artificial forest was 50 m wide (in the east–west direction) and 60 m long (in the south–north direction). This forest is dominated by Populus tomentosa. Salix spp., Fraxinus chinensis, and Pinus tabulaeformis are also present in small numbers. The average distance between two adjacent trees was 9.54 m. At the edge 
PM concentration variation and meteorological conditions
As shown in Fig. 3, the PM concentration changes in different seasons on all the three land use types had the same trend. The lowest average value occurred in the early autumn, followed by which in midsummer. While the concentrations in late autumn and spring were relatively high. In addition the values in late autumn had the wildest range and frequent sharp increases. The PM concentrations on different land use types in the same time did not show obvious difference. Table 3 shows mean
Dry deposition velocity and meteorological conditions
The Monin-Obukhov length tends to be larger and had a wilder variation range in early autumn and spring, which means the atmospheric conditions are less stable and the friction velocity values in winter are relatively high followed by which in early autumn, summer and spring. And the wind speed changes tempestuously except in summer. The friction velocity and atmospheric stability strongly influence the deposition velocities as well as the PM concentration (Connan, 2013, Mammarella, 2011, Tai
Conclusion
From the analysis of this article, we can conclude the following:
(1)
Forests, wetlands and lakes can deposit PMs efficiently while the forest have the best ability to remove the FP pollution and the lake can remove more CP pollution. And artificial forests should be recommended for PM pollution removal.
(2)
The maximum FP deposition occurred in winter while the CP occurred in spring as well as the PM concentrations and the dry deposition influenced by both atmospheric condition and the PM concentrations.
