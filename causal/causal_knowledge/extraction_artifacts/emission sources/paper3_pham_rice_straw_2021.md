## Key Findings

### Emission Factors (EFs) from Rice Straw Open Burning (RSOB)
- **PM2.5**: 34.0 ± 17.6 g/kg rice straw (field experiments)
- **SO2**: 1.4 ± 1.1 g/kg RS (field) / 1.82 ± 1.77 g/kg RS (hood)
- **CO**: Emission factor determined
- **NO2**: Emission factor determined
- **PAHs**: Particle-bound PAHs including benzo[a]pyrene (BaP)

### Total Annual Emissions from RSOB in Hanoi
- **CO2**: 369.6 Gg/year
- **CO**: 13.7 Gg/year
- **SO2**: 0.67 Gg/year
- **NO2**: 0.35 Gg/year
- **PM2.5**: 10.8 Gg/year
- **PAHs**: 32 Mg/year (total 10 particle-bound PAHs)

### Key Quotes for Extraction

**Biomass Burning → PM2.5**:
> "Rice straw open burning (RSOB) after harvest is one of the considerable emission sources in agricultural activities and contributed to air pollution in Vietnam."

> "The PM2.5 emission factor obtained for open field burning (34.0 ± 17.6 g kg−1 RS)... was higher in comparison with the values reported in Thailand and China."

**Mechanism**:
> "Based on the EFs developed in this study, we estimated that RSOB released the amount of 369.6 Gg for CO2, 13.7 Gg for CO, 0.67 Gg for SO2, 0.35 Gg for NO2, 10.8 Gg for PM2.5, and 32 Mg for total 10 particle-bound PAHs to the atmosphere in Hanoi."

**PAH Emissions**:
> "The higher proportion and the contribution of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) to the total 10 detected PAHs bound to PM2.5 in RS burning smoke was the first observation in this study."

### Study Details
- **Location**: Hanoi, Vietnam (North Vietnam)
- **Method**: Hood experiments and field experiments
- **Burning type**: Small pile burning (common practice by farmers)
- **Seasons**: Rice harvest seasons (June and October in Hanoi)

### Relevance to Hanoi PM2.5
- Rice straw burning is a major agricultural emission source
- Higher emission factors than Thailand and China
- Contributes 10.8 Gg PM2.5/year to Hanoi atmosphere
- Also emits precursors: SO2, NO2, VOCs (PAHs)
