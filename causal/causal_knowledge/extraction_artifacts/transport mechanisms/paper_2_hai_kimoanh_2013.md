## Key Findings về Transport Mechanisms

### 1. Wind Speed + Synoptic Pattern → PM Accumulation
- **Mechanism**: High 24h PM levels were observed at low wind speeds when a stagnating ridge governed over Northern Vietnam
- **Quote**: "High 24 h PM levels were observed at low wind speeds when a stagnating ridge governed over Northern Vietnam"
- **Conditions**: Low wind speeds, stagnating ridge synoptic pattern

### 2. Wind Direction + Local Sources → PM2.5 Levels
- **Mechanism**: Daily PM2.5 levels were found to closely link to local wind speeds and directions (relative to local emission sources)
- **Quote**: "The daily PM2.5 levels were found to closely link to local wind speeds and directions (relative to local emission sources)"
- **Conditions**: Wind direction relative to emission sources

### 3. Regional Synoptic Meteorology → Long-range Transport → PM2.5
- **Mechanism**: Regional synoptic meteorology suggesting that both local sources and LRT contributed to the high PM levels
- **Quote**: "regional synoptic meteorology suggesting that both local sources and LRT contributed to the high PM levels at the site"
- **Method**: HYSPLIT back-trajectories

### 4. Source Attribution via PMF
- PMF model revealed 7 source factors of PM2.5:
  - Secondary mixed PM: 40%
  - Diesel traffic: 10%
  - Residential/commercial cooking: 16%
  - Secondary sulfate rich: 16%
  - Aged seasalt mixed: 11%
  - Industry/incinerator: 6%
  - Construction/soil: 1%
- **Quote**: "Major part of PM2.5 mass appeared to link to local emission origins"

## Spatial Scope
- Hanoi, Red River Delta
- About 100 km from the East Vietnam Sea

## Temporal Scope
- Study period: December 2006 – February 2007
- Focus: Dry winter period

## Key Quantitative Data
- 24h PM2.5: 76 ± 32 μg/m³ (range: 26-143 μg/m³)
- 24h PM10: 98 ± 35 μg/m³ (range: 37-165 μg/m³)
- PM2.5 contributed 76% to PM10
