Abstract
A dozen multi-day pollution episodes occur from October to February in Hanoi, Vietnam due to prolonged anticyclonic conditions established after the northeast monsoon surges (cold surges). These winter pollution episodes (WPEs) account for most of the 24-h PM10 exceedances and the highest concentrations of gaseous pollutants in Hanoi. In this study, WPEs were investigated using continuous air quality monitoring data and information on upper-air soundings and air mass trajectories. The 24-h pollutant concentrations are lowest during cold surges; concurrently rise thereafter reaching the highest levels toward the middle of a monsoon cycle, then decline ahead of the next cold surge. Each monsoon cycle usually proceeds through a dry phase and a humid phase as Asiatic continental cold air arrives in Hanoi through inland China then via the East China Sea. WPEs are associated with nighttime radiation temperature inversions (NRTIs) in the dry phase and subsidence temperature inversions (STIs) in the humid phase. In NRTI periods, the rush hour pollution peak is more pronounced in the evening than in the morning and the pollution level is about two times higher at night than in daytime. In STI periods, broad morning and evening traffic peaks are observed and pollution is as high at night as in daytime. The close association between pollution and winter monsoon meteorology found in this study for the winter 2003–04 may serve as a basis for advance warning of WPEs and for forecasting the 24-h pollutant concentrations.
Highlights
► Dozen pollution episodes from Oct. to Feb in Hanoi associated with anticyclones after monsoon surges. ► 24-h concentrations of PM10, SO2, NO2, CO rise after surge and decline ahead of the next. ► Episodes caused by nighttime radiation and subsidence inversions in dry and humid monsoon phases. ► Distinct diurnal variations of pollutant concentrations observed in the two periods. ► Close pollution–meteorology association serve as a basis for warning and forecasting.
Introduction
Hanoi is among Asian cities experiencing high levels of particulate matter in ambient air (Kim Oanh et al., 2006, Hopke et al., 2008). Concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM10) are about twice the annual mean limit (50 μg m−3), and exceed the 24-h legislation threshold (150 μg m−3) on 45 to 50 days each year (Hien et al., 2002).
The particulate pollution level varies substantially over a year. Particulate mass loadings are low in summer (May–September), when the East Asian southeast monsoon driven by tropical maritime air from the Pacific and Indian Oceans brings in hot weather and convective conditions. Conversely, high particulate mass loadings occur in winter (October–March), when Hanoi is impacted by the East Asian northeast monsoon. This monsoon brings continental cold air from the Asiatic high pressure systems to northern Vietnam either through inland China (dry weather) or via the East China Sea (humid weather) (Toan and Dac, 1993). In particular, multi-day winter pollution episodes (WPEs) that account for most of the 24-h PM10 exceedances usually occur in association with nighttime radiation temperature inversion (NRTI) and subsidence temperature inversion (STI) in the dry and humid phases of a monsoon cycle, respectively (Hien et al., 2002).
Automated air quality monitoring facilities installed in 2002 in Hanoi reveal that these WPEs also involve other pollutants. Data obtained to date show that the 24-h concentrations of particulate (PM10) and gaseous pollutants (SO2, NO, NO2, CO etc.) concurrently rise after the intrusion of cold air (cold surge) and reach maxima at some time in the middle of a monsoon cycle and decline ahead of the next cold surge. All air pollutants exhibit lowest concentrations during cold surges.
Song et al. (2006) also found a rather similar trend for PM10 at several monitoring stations in Beijing where the intrusion of cold air from the East Asian anticyclones occurs in average cycles of 4 days. In Hong Kong, particulate pollution episodes also occur in winter when the weather is influenced by the East Asian anticyclones (Air Service Group, 2003, Louie et al., 2005).
In Hanoi, recurring northeast monsoon cycles leave a dozen multi-day pollution episodes between October and February. Directing emission control measures specifically upon these periods would greatly improve the effectiveness of efforts aimed at combating air pollution in Hanoi and reducing the health risk associated with prolonged and simultaneous exposures to many types of air pollutants. Such a targeted strategy requires reliable advance warnings of WPEs and forecasting of pollutant concentrations.
For this purpose, in this study we investigate atmospheric conditions governing the daily and diurnal variations of pollutant concentrations during winter in Hanoi. The analysis was done using information on air pollution and meteorology for the winter of October 2003 to February 2004. The study period covering 16 northeast monsoon cycles can be regarded as representing the situation that occurs from year to year in winter in Hanoi.
The consistency gained in characterizing winter monsoon conditions associated with WPEs by using combined information on surface and upper-air meteorology and air mass trajectories serves as a basis for predicting oncoming WPEs that can be incorporated into routine weather forecast. Furthermore, the close association between pollution and meteorology found in this study also provides an important justification for developing statistical models capable of forecasting next-day air pollutant concentrations using meteorological parameters as explanatory variables. These models will be presented in a forthcoming paper.

Monitoring site and facilities
The air quality monitoring station of the National Hydro-Meteorological Center is located in the Hanoi meteorological garden (21° 03′ N, 105° 48′ E), about 100 m from a road and 6–8 km from industrial suburban areas. Besides surface observations, upper-air radiosonde balloons are released at this garden twice a day at 7:00 am (00:00 GMT) and 7:00 pm (12:00 GMT) providing vertical profiles of atmospheric parameters.
PM10 and PM2.5 have been collected at this site since 1998 by using manual air
Status of air pollution in Hanoi as derived from continuous air quality monitoring data
The annual mean concentrations of PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO are 89, 38, 28, and 1530 μg m−3, respectively. For information, Fig. 1 shows the 2003 mean pollutant concentrations in Hanoi with those in Hong Kong (Air Service Group, 2003), which is about 900 km to the east of Hanoi, and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) (Tuan, 2010), about 1200 km south of Hanoi. Under the influence of the same East Asian monsoon regime, pollutant concentrations in the three cities are lowest in July and highest in December (Air
The East Asian anticyclones and winter monsoons
In winter, large areas of East Asia are affected by northerly to northeasterly monsoons driven by continental surface anticyclones, which frequently develop over Lake Baikal in Siberia (Lam, 1976). As Lake Baikal is located at the same longitude as the eastern edge of the Tibetan plateau, strong northerly winds subsiding near Lake Baikal are not blocked by the Himalayas, but drive polar continental cold air southwards across China (Chu, 1978). At any given location a winter monsoon cycle begins 
Diurnal behaviors of pollutant concentrations during NRTI and STI periods
Pollutant concentrations exhibit different diurnal behaviors during the three periods, as shown by monitoring data for December 2003 in Fig. 6, Fig. 7.
From December 10 to 12, hourly pollutant concentrations were very low due to high winds accompanying cold air arrivals. No near surface temperature inversions were observed on these days. Both the morning and evening traffic pollution peaks were weakly pronounced (Fig. 6).
On the 13th, calm conditions suddenly appeared from 5:00 pm and the first
Discussion and summary
Multi-day pollution episodes involving all types of air pollutants usually occur in Hanoi following the northeast monsoon surges in winter that bring in continental cold air from the Asiatic high-pressure anticyclone. This study provides insights into the atmospheric processes underlying the occurrence and evolution of WPEs using continuous monitoring data on air pollutants and surface meteorology as well as information on upper-air soundings and air mass trajectories. Although the analysis was
