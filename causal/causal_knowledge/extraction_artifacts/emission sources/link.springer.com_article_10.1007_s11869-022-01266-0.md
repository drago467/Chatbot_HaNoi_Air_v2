Abstract

Forty-seven ambient 24-h PM2.5 samples were collected during summer and fall at a typical inner-city sampling site in Hanoi, a metropolitan city in Vietnam for characterization, inorganic chemical fractionation, source apportionment, and potential health risk assessment of airborne PM2.5. The average 24-h PM2.5 concentrations observed in this study were substantially higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The most abundant elements in PM2.5 were Al, Fe, Pb, and Zn accounting for 85.14% and 89.06% of the total obtained elements in summer and fall, respectively. Noticeably, the levels of Cd were 40.33 times in summer and 26.64 times in fall higher than WHO guidelines. The obtained results from principal component analysis (PCA) combined with enrichment factor (EF) analysis showed good agreement and suggested that the major sources of PM2.5 were non-exhaust traffic emission and crustal dust, exhaust traffic emission, coal combustion, and industrial source. Both the hazard index (HI) and carcinogenic risk (CR) values of all investigated elements were lower than the safe levels for adults and children in the two seasons. However, the carcinogenic risks of Cr for both adults and children were close to the acceptable values, implying potential carcinogenic risks caused by this metal. Besides, both the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks for children were substantially higher than that for adults, suggesting more attention on children’s health adverse effects resulting from exposure to trace metals bounded with PM2.5 in Hanoi should be paid.
