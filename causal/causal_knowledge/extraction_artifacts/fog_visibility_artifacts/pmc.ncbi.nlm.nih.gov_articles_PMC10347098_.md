Abstract

With the increasing need for particulate matter (PM) monitoring, the demand for light-scattering sensors that allow for real-time measurements of PM is increasing. This light-scattering method involves irradiating light to the aerosols in the atmosphere to analyze the scattered light and measure mass concentrations. Humidity affects the measurement results. The humidity in an outdoor environment may exist as gas or steam, such as fog. While the impact of humidity on the light-scattering measurement remains unclear, an accurate estimation of ambient PM concentration is a practical challenge. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of humidity on light-scattering measurements by analyzing the variation in the PM concentration measured by the sensor when relative humidity was due to gaseous and steam vapor. The gaseous humidity did not cause errors in the PM measurements via the light-scattering method. In contrast, steam humidity, such as that caused by fog, resulted in errors in the PM measurement. The results help determine the factors to be considered before applying a light-scattering sensor in an outdoor environment. Based on these factors, directions for technological development can be presented regarding the correction of measurement errors induced by vapor in outdoor environments.

1. Introduction

Particulate matter (PM) is an aerosol in a solid or liquid form that is known to have various harmful effects on the human body. Therefore, the importance of measuring PM concentrations has been increasingly emphasized [1,2,3,4]. The well-known methods used to measure PM concentrations are the gravimetric, beta-ray, and light-scattering methods. The gravimetric method is mostly used as a reference method for PM measurement because of its high accuracy [5]. However, it refers to offline manual filter sampling conducted for a long term (typically 24 h), and the measured data are usually not available for a while because of the weighing process [6,7]. The beta-ray method is also known as one of the highly accurate methods for PM measurement. It estimates PM mass using beta-ray energy attenuation across a PM filter, and this process takes a much shorter time compared to the gravimetric method. However, the time resolution still takes a few minutes, and the large size and high cost of the instrument are the weaknesses for wide application [7]. Each method has its own merits and demerits, but the most suitable method for real-time concentration monitoring is the light-scattering method [8]. In this method, light is irradiated to the airborne PM, such that the light is scattered by the PM. If the irradiation of light targets the PMs with identical physical properties, the amount of scattered light will be proportional to the mass concentration of the PMs; thus, the amount of scattered light can be measured and used to estimate the PM concentration [9,10,11]. This method allows for real-time monitoring, easy portability, and simultaneous measurements of particles such as PM2.5, PM10, and total suspended particles according to particle size using a single device. However, errors may occur when converting the particle number concentration into the mass concentration. Despite the risk of potential errors, a light-scattering PM sensor serves well as a simple and portable PM detector based on its ready portability. Notably, the demand for air quality monitoring techniques corresponding to the recent advancement of smart technology that can be applied in smart cities has been increasing. Consequently, PM sensors that can be employed in the light-scattering method for outdoor monitoring should be developed [12].

A greater number of factors should be considered for outdoor measurements of PM concentration than for indoor measurements. In particular, the characteristics of the light-scattering method help measure not only the airborne dust particles but also the vapor as an aerosol, thus posing a challenge to the accurate measurement of dust concentration outdoors, where the amount of vapor in the atmosphere fluctuates more frequently than that indoors. Hence, several previous studies have identified variations in relative humidity (RH) as a factor influencing the PM measurement obtained using light-scattering sensors; RH has been the main factor to consider when monitoring the PM under outdoor conditions [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. However, RH is a concept indicating the concentration of vapor in a gaseous state in the atmosphere [23,24], and therefore, it theoretically cannot be the primary factor affecting the PM concentration in the light-scattering method, as the method counts the aerosols in solid and liquid states [25,26]. For an extremely high RH, the condensation of vapor on the airborne PM could affect the changes in PM concentration in physical terms, and if the vapor is not in a gaseous state but a state of liquid aerosol (or steam), such as fog, it could be the target of light-scattering sensors [27]. However, most previous studies have not been able to clearly distinguish the light-scattering effect according to the variation in the state of the ambient humidity and report the findings that solely reflect the changes in RH.

Thus, to determine the effects of humidity on the PM measurements obtained using light-scattering sensors, an empirical study was conducted to analyze the variations in the PM concentration measured after supplying gaseous and steam vapor. Consequently, the trend of the variations in the PM concentration measured by the sensor was examined for an increase in RH caused by gaseous vapor and steam vapor. Ultimately, based on the results, the factors to be considered for applying light-scattering sensors to measure PM concentration under outdoor conditions were discussed.

2. Materials and Methods

In this study, two independent tests were conducted to identify the effects of gaseous and steam humidity on the measurements of PM using light-scattering sensors. First, an RH test was conducted to analyze the variations in the PM measurements owing to gaseous vapor with a direct impact on RH values. Second, a steam RH test was conducted to analyze the variations in the PM measurements owing to steam vapor with liquid-state particles. The PM sensor used in the tests was Cubic PM2009 (Cubic Sensor and Instrument Co. Ltd., Wuhan, China) with an IP65 level of dustproof and waterproof performance, which can be applied under outdoor conditions [28]. To apply the PM sensor, a measuring instrument was developed to measure the humidity and temperature with the PM concentration simultaneously. This instrument was a prototype, and its performance was experimentally validated in a prior test, i.e., “Certification of Simple Fine Dust Meter” based on the “Special Act on PM Reduction and Management” in South Korea [29,30]. The reliability of the instrument was thus verified via a certification test under low-RH conditions. The results of the two tests were analyzed to identify the effects of the state of ambient humidity on the PM measurements obtained using light-scattering sensors, and the considerations when applying the sensors in an outdoor environment were discussed. The relevant framework of this study is presented in Figure 1.

2.1. RH Test

The RH test was conducted under the conditions described in Figure 2 to measure the PM concentrations corresponding to a constant change in RH induced by the supply of gaseous vapor in a sealed chamber. In this manner, the effects on PM measurements related to RH were analyzed. The test was performed in a 30 m3 test chamber containing an electric heating and humidifying system that supported an all-in-one dust monitoring test. The test was conducted according to the “Test Method for Optically Equivalent PM Mass or Number Concentration Measurement using Low-Cost Dust Sensor” as a certified method for air purifiers in South Korea. For the generated particles, the A1 ULTRAFINE TEST DUST of ISO 12103-1 was used, and for the dust generator, SAG 410 of TOPAS was used [31,32]. In addition, the conditions inside the test chamber were such that the RH was altered by 10% each time under a constant temperature (24 ± 0.5 °C), while the concentrations of PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10 were measured using the three pilot devices developed in this study. The sections below RH 30% were extremely dry regions with a negligible level of impact of RH and were thus removed from the scope of the test. In addition, the sections beyond RH 70% posed a difficulty in maintaining the inner chamber RH at a constant level; hence, the data collected from RH 30% to 70% were used, and the results from over RH 70% were excluded from the analyses.

The test procedure is summarized as follows: three measuring instruments for the test were selected at random and positioned at the center of the chamber. The chamber interior was thoroughly ventilated to ensure a state without PM, and the reference RH condition for the test to be performed in such a clean-state chamber was provided, while the generation of particles was controlled to reach the reference level of 50 μg/m3 which is the standard level of high PM concentration in Korea [33]. As PM particles sink in time to decrease the PM concentration inside the chamber, the PM concentration measurements for the first five minutes, which were obtained immediately after checking a stabilized level of 50 μg/m3 concentration of PM2.5 for each RH condition (i.e., five PM values per minute), were used as the data to be analyzed.

2.2. Steam RH Test

The steam RH test was conducted to analyze the effects of steam vapor, i.e., a liquid-state aerosol such as fog, on the measured PM concentrations in an outdoor environment. For this, three measuring instruments were installed inside a sealed lab at identical heights of 1.5 m, and an ultrasonic humidifier was installed at the center of the lab to supply steam. There are three broad types of humidifiers: vaporizing, heating, and ultrasonic. The vaporizing humidifier supplies a gaseous vapor, and the heating humidifier may affect the temperature change inside the lab. Therefore, the device selected for supplying steam was the ultrasonic humidifier [34,35,36]. The test was performed five times (RH 40–80%), as the reference RH with the operation of the humidifier was increased by approximately 10% each week. The lab conditions before the test were RH ≤ 40% with all three PM types, PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10, below 10 μg/m3. A certain duration is required for the lab conditions to settle to a constant level immediately after the RH has been increased; therefore, the data for the first day of each week were excluded from the analyses. The sealed lab with the installed devices for the steam RH test is shown in Figure 3.

2.3. Analysis of Test Results

Based on the results of the RH test and steam RH test, the correlation between RH and PM concentration was analyzed to identify the effects of gaseous and steam humidity on PM measurements obtained using light-scattering sensors. For the correlation analysis, the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software was used, and the trend of the optimal variations in PM concentrations for different RH sections in each test was analyzed. The results of the analyses were ultimately used for discussing the factors to be considered to monitor the PM concentrations under outdoor conditions.

3.2. Steam RH Test Data

In the steam RH test, the PM concentration was measured according to the RH set by the humidifier, and the results of 7980 data for (a) PM1.0, (b) PM2.5, and (c) PM10, respectively are shown in Figure 4. The steam supply from the humidifier used in this study was continued and discontinued to maintain the set RH; because of this limitation, a constant RH level could not be maintained. Hence, among the collected data, the data within the ±1% range for each RH level were retained and plotted and analyzed. The final set of 1044 extracted data for (a) PM1.0, (b) PM2.5, and (c) PM10, respectively used in the analyses are presented in Figure 5.
