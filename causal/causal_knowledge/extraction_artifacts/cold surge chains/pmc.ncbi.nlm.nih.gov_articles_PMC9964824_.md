3.3. Effect of Secondary Aerosols

Based on the diurnal variation of PM2.5, NOx, SO2, and CO (results not shown), only daytime hours (here, 06–18 LT) were considered. The selected hours include early morning hours when the pollutants concentration represents the fresh emission due to increased anthropogenic activities and later hours when the chemical and photochemical reaction occurs. The average values for PM2.5/CO, NOx/CO, and SO2/CO for the 13 episodes that are potentially affected by secondary aerosol formation are given in Table 4. The average value of PM2.5/CO is higher during episodic days as compared to the clean days for all the episodes. Both NOx/CO and SO2/CO decrease during episodic days in five episodes, which suggests the potential formation of both sulphate and nitrate PM. Eight episodes showed a drop in only NOx/CO, suggesting the formation of only nitrate particles. Six out of these thirteen episodes are induced by sea breezes (Type II haze), which are also associated with relatively higher relative humidity, which could play important role in the formation of secondary aerosols. However, the effect of secondary aerosols is also found in the other three haze types. These results suggest the potential role of secondary aerosol in haze formation, but it may not be present in all cases.

3.4. Effect of Biomass Burning

The details of the episodes that are potentially affected by biomass burning are given in Table 5. A total of 86 days out of 541 days between 2017 and 2022 were identified to have wind trajectories pass over fire hotspot areas before reaching Bangkok, hence potentially contributing to air pollution in GBK. However, this potential contribution seems to be significant only for 42 days when haze develops in Bangkok. A total of 19 episodes out of 38 seem to have limited to-serve effects on haze episodes based on the assumption that a minimum of one day during a haze episode should have the wind trajectory coming from fire hotspots regions. Based on the trajectories and fire hotspots examination, the effect of biomass burning was classified into two types: (a) low impact, and (b) high impact. The haze episodes for which the number of days with biomass burning effect was less than 50% of the total duration of haze episodes were considered to have a low impact or otherwise. The high impact is found in over 10 episodes, which are short haze episodes of 1–2 days. For the remaining nine medium-to-long-duration haze episodes, the effect of biomass burning is in complement with the local anthropogenic emission and stagnant weather conditions. It should be noted that many days which were classified to have the effect of biomass burning do not have a haze over Bangkok due to favorable conditions for the dilution of the air pollutants.

For illustration, the fire hotspot maps and daily 120 h back-trajectories for Episode 20 (low impact) and Episode 25 (high impact) are displayed in Figure 6 and Figure 7, respectively. Episode 20 spans four days (11–14 January 2019), classified as Type II (i.e., under cold surge alone). Fires are more seen in Cambodia than in Thailand throughout the episode (and also a few days after). No back-trajectories pass over the dense fire areas before reaching GBK, except on the second day. However, the corresponding back-trajectory does not stay at low levels. Episode 25 spans three days (18–20 January 2020), classified as Type IV (not under either cold surge or sea breeze). Like the previous episode, fires occur more intensely in Cambodia. Although fires in Cambodia may potentially influence haze in the study during the first two days, only the second day has the back-trajectory moving slowly at low levels over the dense fire areas.

4. Discussion

Motivated by the importance of winter-time haze and its association with meteorology, this study presents an effort to review recent haze episodes in GBK using the meteorological classification for haze with cold surge and sea breeze as the central framework. The findings from the investigation and analysis indicate that winter-time haze involves multiple factors, such as emissions, meteorology (at local, meso-, and synoptic scales), and secondary aerosols. Short haze episodes tend to couple with the cold surge or sea breeze alone, but extended haze episodes can experience and couple with the cold surge and sea breeze individually or combined. Prolonged haze can permit favorable conditions for secondary aerosol formation. GBK has a very large number of emission sources. Transport (particularly on-road) and industries are the typical major sectors. Nevertheless, the influence of biomass burning (within, outside, or distant from the study area) and secondary aerosols are sometimes non-negligible. Based on the precursor-ratio method applied here, 13 episodes (out of 38) are potentially affected by secondary aerosols. Narita et al. (2019) [17] also reported secondary aerosols as a contributor to haze in the study area using source apportionment. As found here, a number of the haze episodes considered were impacted by biomass burning to varying degrees. Aman et al. (2020) [7] investigated the day-to-day evolution of two winter-time haze episodes with contrasting impacts of biomass burning. Phairuang et al. (2019) [18] reported a significant contribution from agricultural burning in Central Thailand and forest fires in the north to particulate pollution in Bangkok during winter. Dejchanchaiwong et al. (2020) [19] found fires in Thailand and Cambodia to be a contributor to a haze episode in Bangkok. Aman et al. 2022 [20] analyzed two low-visibility events in Bangkok, both of which were partly affected by biomass burning.

Some policy implications related to haze in GBK can be derived from the findings in this study: (1) Many haze episodes are well associated with the synoptic (cold surge) and mesoscale (sea breeze) processes, posing a challenge to haze mitigation by emission reduction. (2) Secondary aerosols contribute to haze, needing to control their gaseous precursors. (3) Biomass burning, though not considered a major contributor in all haze episodes, should also be managed, indicating a need for a comprehensive emission database to support the design and implementation of measures to cope with haze properly.

5. Conclusions

In this study, haze characteristics under the influence of cold surge and sea breeze were investigated using the observed data over Greater Bangkok (GBK) in 2017–2022, including haze intensity and duration, and meteorology-based haze classification, as well as the potential effects of secondary aerosols and biomass burning. A total of 159 haze days and 38 haze episodes were identified. Haze duration (per episode) varies from a single day to many days (up to 8–14 days), the latter of which signifies the long-lasting persistence of haze and also indicates different pathways of formation and evolution of haze episodes. Eighteen haze episodes are short-duration episodes of 1–2 days, and the frequency of haze episodes decreases with an increase in haze duration. The larger values of the coefficient of variation of PM2.5 in relatively long episodes suggest the increased complexity in the haze formation and evolution. The four haze types (Types I–IV) were identified, accounting for cold surges, sea breeze, and their coupling. Both cold surges and sea breeze are two important atmospheric processes that influence winter-time weather conditions for the study area, particularly December–February. In Type I, a haze episode is triggered by the arrival of the cold surge in the pre-haze period, with stagnant weather that is favorable for haze later. Type II corresponds to haze induced by the sea breeze with pollutants accumulated likely due to local recirculation and the thermal internal boundary layer. For Type III, haze is driven by the synergetic effect of the cold surge and sea breeze. For Type IV, haze is neither under cold surge influence nor under sea breeze influence. Type II is the most frequently occurring haze type with a total of 15 episodes. Type III has the highest average duration of 10.8 days with six persistent haze episodes, while Type IV has mostly single-day haze episodes. Type III is also the most polluted haze type due to the synergetic effect of the cold surge and sea breeze and haze spreading broadly beyond GBK in the north and northeast directions due to advection and dispersion. Type I is the driest and coolest due to the effect of cold surge, while Type II is the most humid with the highest recirculation factor due to the highest average sea breeze duration and penetration. Type IV has mostly single-day episodes, and higher AOD is found over larger regions near GBK possibly due to biomass burning. The precursor ratio method applied indicates the potential effect of secondary aerosols for 13 haze episodes (34%). Using the visual examination of back-trajectories and fire hotspots, biomass burning can be readily seen to affect 19 episodes (50%), but the high impact is mostly constrained to the relatively short haze episodes, while the relatively long haze episodes correspond to a mixed impact from biomass burning, local emissions, and meteorology.

Future work to further the understanding of haze in the study area can be extended to the following topics: quantified contributions of meteorology and emissions to haze [57], health impact of air pollution [58], vertical evolution of haze and atmospheric stability during cold surges and sea breezes, [59], quantitative meteorological classification [60], episodic chemical characterization and source apportionment, and the spatiotemporal variation of haze with satellite-based PM2.5 mapping using statistical and machine learning modeling [61]. It is also useful to incorporate more PM2.5 data into the analysis if the monitoring network becomes more extensive over the study area. Given that the sea breeze was shown to influence haze, its associated parameters should be incorporated into predictive models for haze and tested.
