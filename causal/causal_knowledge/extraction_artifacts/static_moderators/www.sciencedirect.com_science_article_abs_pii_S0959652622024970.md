Abstract
Although many studies have focused on the effects of industrial agglomeration on environmental pollution, their conclusions have differed. In addition, few studies have measured the industrial agglomeration from the perspective of the spatial distribution of factories and explored its effect on the environment. Using the Factory Scatter Index, this paper explored the effects of the spatial agglomeration of high-pollution factories on PM2.5 pollution in China from 1998 to 2013. The spatial distribution of high-pollution factories showed that there is an increasingly scattered spatial distribution of the high-pollution factories in 1998–2013, and the fastest growth in the number of factories was mainly at the administrative junctions of provinces and cities. The empirical analysis of the spatial panel model shows that the spatial agglomeration of high-pollution factories in China aggravated PM2.5 pollution, while the negative impact was reduced or even absent in Eastern China and urban agglomerations due to the higher level of economic development and effective management. The results of this paper may help local governments better understand the impact of industrial agglomeration on environmental pollution, and emphasize that governments need to strengthen the supervision and management while promoting the spatial agglomeration of high-pollution factories.
Introduction
Environmental pollution, especially air pollution induced by industrial waste gas, soot, and coal combustion by-products, has become a serious global problem (Rauner, 2020; Geng et al., 2021). Besides conventional air pollutants such as NO2 and SO2, particles with a diameter <2.5 μm (denoted as PM2.5) are major air pollutants. PM2.5 pollution can cause a variety of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, resulting in severe negative effects on human health (Lu et al., 2020). Therefore, in recent years, PM2.5 pollution has become a matter of public concern (Geng et al., 2021).
As a response to the PM2.5 pollution challenge, Chinese government has adopted several measures, such as developing energy-saving technologies and using green and clean energy (Han et al., 2014; Hao and Liu, 2016; Chen et al., 2018; Lin and Jia, 2019). Many studies have explored the effects of the spatial agglomeration of factories on environmental pollution (Melo et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2020), but no consensus has been achieved yet (Shao and Li, 2017).
Although the agglomeration of manufacturing factories is usually accompanied with increasing resource consumption and pollutant, which deteriorate the pollution in surrounding areas (Chen et al., 2020), some scholars have found that industrial agglomeration had a pollution reduction effect in recent years (Chen et al., 2018; Wang and Wang, 2019). These studies explained the pollution reduction effect from the following aspects: First, the industrial agglomeration can contribute to the development and application of clean energy technologies (Wang and Nie, 2016). Second, industrial agglomeration enables factories to share professional pollution abatement facilities. In addition, industrial agglomeration is conducive to the unified management and supervision of the government (Wang and Wang, 2019). The pollution reduction effect of industrial agglomeration has been confirmed by a large number of relevant empirical studies. Using the data from the Yangtze River Delta in China, Chen and Hu (2008) found that industrial agglomeration promoted technological progress and improved regional environment. Lu and Feng (2014), and Chen et al. (2018) showed that the industrial agglomeration could effectively reduce pollution discharge per unit of economic output.
As the scholars and policymakers recognize the above advantages of industrial agglomeration, local governments began to gradually emphasize industrial agglomeration in regional development plans, and have established various special economic zones such as industrial parks and technical innovation parks to strengthen industrial agglomeration. However, local governments, especially those in some less-developed areas, gave priority to economic growth and tended to lower the environmental regulatory standards to attract factories and adopt relatively loose environmental standards for the factories located in these industrial agglomeration areas. Moreover, factories agglomerate in a specific region tends to adopt the “environmental free-riding” strategy (Yang and Chou, 2018). Therefore, some industrial parks have become seriously polluted areas (Wang and Nie, 2016). In addition to the above views, some studies considered that there was a non-linear relationship between industrial agglomeration and pollution (Wang and Wang, 2019). In the initial stage, industrial agglomeration leads to concentrated pollution; as the agglomeration of factories proceeds, clean technologies are shared among factories, and governments are able to optimize emission management practices, thereby increasing energy efficiency and reducing negative environmental effects. However, it is still not clear that which stage of industrial agglomeration is in China.
Based on our previous studies, we believe that the improper measurement index of industrial agglomeration might be responsible for the inconsistent conclusion of the studies on the relationship between industrial agglomeration and pollution. The Gini coefficient, the Herfindahl index, and the EG index, which are commonly used to measure industrial agglomeration from the perspective of the proportion of output value or the proportion of employees (Chen et al., 2020), cannot reflect the spatial distance between factories. As shown in Fig. 1, we assume that there are exactly the same N factories distributed in Region A, Region B, and Region C. Thus, the three regions have the same Herfindahl or EG index value, which means the industrial agglomeration in the three regions are identical. However, as can be seen in Fig. 1, the spatial distribution of the factories in these three regions is completely different. For example, the factories in Region A are distributed on the outermost periphery, whereas the factories in Region B are evenly distributed in the region, and the factories in Region C are clustered in a small area. In this case, the geographic distances of factories in Region C are the shortest, which means the promotion of clean technology and unified governmental management might be easier to achieve in Region C. Therefore, traditional agglomeration indicators do not fully reflect the spatial distribution and distances of factories, and it is more appropriate to measure agglomeration from a spatial perspective.
Following the study of Zheng et al. (2019), this paper uses the Factory Scatter Index (FSI) to measure the degree of scattering of manufacturing factories. The FSI reflects the dispersion of the factories by calculating the average distance between all factories in a region. A higher FSI indicates a more scattered degree of the factories. Using the index, the effects of the spatial agglomeration of factories on groundwater withdraw in China have previously been explored (Zheng et al., 2019, 2021).
Moreover, most previous studies have considered all types of factories as their research subjects (Wang and Nie, 2016; Wang and Wang, 2019). However, different types of factories have different impacts on environmental pollution. The industrial sector accounts for roughly 30% of total PM2.5 pollution in China, and more than 90% of the industrial sector pollution comes from high-pollution industries (Fujii et al., 2013). Therefore, the agglomeration of high-pollution factories has a more serious impact on PM2.5 pollution and should be the primary focus of researchers, policymakers, and regulatory agencies (Zhou et al., 2014).
In addition, most studies used provincial level data for analysis and few studies have used prefecture-level data (Chen et al., 2020). In this study, we use the prefecture-level city as the spatial unit of analysis, and the main reasons are as follows: First, due to differences in the levels of economic development and industrialization, there are significant differences in PM2.5 pollution between cities, while the provincial-level analyses may ignore these differences (Li et al., 2014). In addition, there are large spatial scales and large internal differences in provinces, so it is difficult to capture the spatial correlation and spatial spillover effect of PM2.5 using provincial-level data (Cheng, 2016). Second, the prefecture is the basic administrative unit between province and county, which can be used to demonstrate China's urban environmental pollution (Han et al., 2014). Third, the prefecture-level city is also the smallest administrative unit that data is available.
This paper uses the Factory Scatter Index to measure the industrial agglomeration of high-pollution factories and investigates its impact on PM2.5 pollution from 1998 to 2013. This paper also uses the factory density as the supplementary index of FSI. These two indexes measure the industrial agglomeration from the perspective of distance and density, respectively. In addition, this paper makes a temporal and spatial heterogeneity analysis on the impact of high-pollution factories agglomeration on PM2.5 pollution in different regions in China. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the materials and methods. Section 3 presents the results and analysis. Second 4 discusses the results, and Section 5 is the conclusion.

Average distance between high-pollution factories: the factory scatter index (FSI)
Following the approach of Zheng et al. (2019), the FSI was proposed to measure the average distance between high-pollution factories by using the longitude and latitude coordinates of each factory.
First, the spatial location database of industrial factories was used to construct a grid with factory j as the center point and d as the radiation radius (Fig. 2).
Second, the average distance between factories in each region was calculated as follows:

The distribution and evolution of high-pollution factories in China
To see the spatiotemporal pattern of high-pollution factories in China, we firstly calculated the number of high-pollution manufacturing plants in 1998 and 2013, respectively, and showed its change rate from 1998 to 2013. Due to the influence of geographical, economic, policy and other factors, the development of eastern, central and western regions of China is obviously different, so the spatial distribution of high-pollution factories can also be different. Therefore, the number of
Characteristics of the spatial distribution of high-pollution manufacturing factories
As shown in Section 3.1, from 1998 to 2013, the trend of high-pollution factories shifting from districts to counties was obvious. The main reasons for this phenomenon are as follows. (1) With increases in costs of land, labor, and management in districts, high-pollution factories have moved from districts to counties in order to reduce production costs, which is consistent with Xu et al. (2020). (2) In the context of fiscal decentralization and GDP championship, the local governments of
Conclusions and applications
Although existing studies have focused on the effects of factory agglomeration on environmental pollution, few studies have measured the degree of scattered distribution of factories, and even fewer studies have explored the impact of the scattered distribution of high-pollution factories on environmental pollution. Research on this issue will help to provide suggestions and references for reducing environmental pollution in China from the perspective of the spatial agglomeration of factories.
