## Key Findings

### Emission Reductions During Lockdown (vs historical data)
- **NO2**: Reduced 75.8% (from 21.6 to 5.2 μg/m³)
- **PM2.5**: Reduced 55.9% (from 98.4 to 43.4 μg/m³)
- **SO2**: Reduced 60.7% (from 13.0 to 5.1 μg/m³)
- **O3**: Reduced 21.4% (from 21.8 to 17.1 μg/m³)

### Emission Reductions (before vs during lockdown 2020)
- **NO2**: Reduced 55.1%
- **PM2.5**: Reduced 18.0%
- **PM2.5 at sampling sites**: Reduced 41.8%

### Key Quotes for Extraction

**Traffic → NO2**:
> "The sharp variation of NO2 concentration is possibly associated with the abrupt decrease in vehicular traffic during the partial lockdown resulting from 'work-from-home' and international and national travel limitations."
> "Hien et al. (2014) demonstrated that exhaust emissions of motorbikes are a major source of NO2 in Hanoi."

**Traffic as Mobile Source**:
> "Both mobile sources (motorcycles (with two-stroke petrol engines), diesel trucks, buses, cars, and boats) and stationary sources (industry, power generation, and burning of biomass) are responsible for air pollution in big cities in Vietnam."
> "There was a significant drop in traffic during the partial lockdown, which caused the reduction of mobile emission sources."

**[NO2]/[SO2] Ratio**:
> "The mean values of [NO2]/[SO2] before the partial lockdown were two times higher than that of the partial lockdown period."
> "A drastic reduction of [NO2]/[SO2] during the partial lockdown was observed in Hanoi due to a significant reduction of mobile sources (vehicular traffic)."

**PM2.5 Multiple Sources**:
> "The decline of PM2.5 was less than the reduction of NO2, which may be because PM2.5 was emitted from multiple non-transportation sources such as industrial factories and biomass burning."

**Industrial Activities**:
> "Although the industrial sector was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, the industry factories and power plants in Vietnam still operate during the partial lockdown, which may lead to an insignificant change in the contribution of stationary sources."

**Trace Elements Reduction During Lockdown**:
- Cu: -45.3%
- Pb: -52.6%
- Zn: -51.7%
- K: -44.7% (biomass burning tracer)
- Ca: -30.1%
- Al: -26.5%

### Study Details
- **Location**: Three urban sites in Hanoi
- **Period**: Before lockdown (Feb 17 - Mar 23, 2020), During lockdown (Apr 1 - Apr 22, 2020)
- **PM2.5 before lockdown**: 73.65-90.67 μg/m³
- **PM2.5 during lockdown**: 47.85 μg/m³

### Mechanisms Identified
1. Traffic reduction → NO2 decrease → PM2.5 decrease
2. Industrial activities continued → SO2 relatively stable
3. Boundary layer height (BLH) negatively correlated with PM2.5 (R = -0.37 to -0.47)
