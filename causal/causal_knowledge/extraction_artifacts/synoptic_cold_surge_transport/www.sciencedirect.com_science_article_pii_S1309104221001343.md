Highlights
•
The evolution of boundary layer was limited under the effect of haze during the polluted winter period in Hanoi.
•
The major pollution events are associated to stable meteorological conditions and air masses coming from the Northeast.
•
During pollution events, the hourly evolution of PM2.5 concentration is essentially controlled by the boundary layer height, besides local emission variability.
•
The chemical composition of PM does not differ significantly from the local or regional sources and long-range transport.
Abstract
With the aim of identifying key factors explaining the severe pollution events that occur under the impact of the Northeast monsoon during the winter period in Hanoi, a two-month campaign was carried out (11 January to 22 March 2019). The local meteorological parameters and the origin of the air masses were investigated, notably using a Doppler Lidar, and the structure of the boundary layer was thoroughly studied using elastic Lidar measurements for the first time in Hanoi. Four heavily polluted events occurred during the campaign, which were associated with hazy days; the highest daily PM2.5 concentrations reached ~130 μg m−3 while the mean concentration during the campaign was 45 ± 25 μg m−3. These severe polluted events in Hanoi were mainly related to LRT coming from China besides local emission or LRT from other polluted regions of Vietnam. BLH proved to be one of the key factors controlling air pollution in Hanoi. Indeed, the elastic Lidar measurements showed that the daily maximum of the hourly BLH varied from 700m to 1200m during cloudy days, while it was always below 1000m during hazy days. The lower BLH on the hazy days weakened the vertical mixing and was directly related to an increase in aerosol concentrations at the surface.

Introduction
A high level of particulate matter (PM), especially PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 2.5 μm), has been proven to adversely impact human health and life quality (Kelly and Fussell, 2012; Pope et al., 2020). Moreover, PM2.5 has been considered as the main pollutant causing severe air pollution issues in cities in Southeast Asia (Reddington et al., 2019; Janta et al., 2020) including Hanoi (Cohen et al., 2010a, 2010b; Hai and Kim Oanh, 2013; Ly et al., 2020). Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, has experienced rapid growth and urbanization over the past two decades along with extreme changes in weather such as atmospheric circulation, air temperature and downward solar radiation (Taylor, 2010; Nguyen et al., 2019), resulting in a severe increase of pollutants such as PM2.5, NOx and SO2.
From 2010 to 2013, considering the EPA's Air Quality Index (AQI), the number of days with unhealthy levels for sensitive groups (AQI = 101–200) accounted for 40–60% of the monitored days at Hanoi, while 102 days and 20 days were associated with very unhealthy (AQI = 201–300) and hazardous (AQI ≥ 300) levels, respectively (MONRE, 2013). Concerning PM, the diurnal particulate concentrations fluctuate substantially along the year. Daily variations of fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10) particulate matter concentrations in Hanoi varied from 26 to 143 μg m−3 and from 37 to 165 μg m−3 respectively (Hai and Kim Oanh, 2013). Furthermore, the number of days with levels of PM10 exceeding the specified Vietnam's standard for ambient air quality in 24-h (≥150 μg m−3) was approximately 50 days per year (Hien et al., 2011) while PM2.5 concentrations exceeding standard (≥50 μg m−3) were also recorded regularly. As a result, air pollution has been identified as one of the major environmental concerns in Hanoi. Northern Vietnam has two main seasons, which include Winter (November–March) and Summer (May–September), and two transitory seasons Spring including (April) and Autumn (October) (MONRE, 2007). Particularly, PM concentrations in Hanoi are lower in summer, when the southeast monsoon directed by tropical maritime air from the Pacific and Indian Oceans delivers hot weather and convective conditions. Conversely, high levels of PM are recorded in winter, when northern Vietnam is affected by the northeast monsoon (Cohen et al., 2010a; Hien et al., 2011; Huy and Kim Oanh, 2017). Moreover, a high-pressure ridge from polar air in Siberia results in the northeast monsoon bringing continental cold air from this area either through inland China (dry period) from November to January or via the Gulf of Tonkin (humid period) from January to March. However, the synoptic motion of air masses is not the only parameter that can explain the pollution levels encountered in Vietnam. A high level of pollutants was noticed in winter in Hanoi for days under haze condition (Ly et al., 2018, 2020), so the humidity can play a notable role in the variation of pollutants. Besides local emissions, long-range transport (LRT) was also considered as a potential source to the high level of PM, especially in winter with a strong impact of the northeast monsoon. Although there was still a debate, a few studies have stated a similar contribution of emission originating from both local and LRT sources in Hanoi (Cohen et al., 2010a; Nguyen et al., 2020).
On the other hand, boundary layer heights (BLH) and vertical wind profiles also play an important role in the vertical mixing and transport of pollutants (Stull, 1988). Solar radiation and weather conditions are the main variables affecting the dynamics of the boundary layer (BL). Inland, BL may undergo a typical daily evolution driven by surface heating, but it is also strongly dependent on local meteorology (haze, sea-breeze) and fronts (Stull, 1988). Concerning wind profiles, horizontal and vertical wind speeds can change quickly in time as well as in space, thus, monitoring these profiles lead to improve our understanding of atmospheric dynamics as well as the evolution of the BL. Radiosonde measurements are considered as the most reliable method for retrieving vertical profiles of meteorological parameters as well as BLH. Unfortunately, soundings are usually released into the atmosphere 2–3 times per day, so this method is not able to monitor continuously the BLH evolution. Nowadays, Lidar becomes more suitable for analyzing the BL structure and determining BLH due to its high spatio-temporal resolution. However, this method requires greater technical resources and it still has some optical limits especially under cloudy weather. In a few recent decades, Lidar's application in order to analyze the BLH is widely applied in many regions of the world like Europe and Asia (Menut et al., 1999; Delbarre et al., 2005; Dieudonné et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2019; Pan et al., 2019). However, similar studies in Southeast Asia, especially in Vietnam are still limited (Hai et al., 2013).
In this study, our goal is to identify the key factors explaining severe pollution events in Hanoi during winter, which is the highest pollution period over the year. The impact of the local meteorological factors and the origin of the air masses will be firstly investigated. In addition, the structure of BL will be thoroughly studied by the Lidar measurements for the first time in Hanoi. The impact of its evolution as well as of atmospheric dynamics on hourly PM2.5 concentrations during pollution episodes will be explored.

Overview of basic meteorological parameters and pollution during the campaign
A summary of the meteorological conditions and their temporal variability for each month is shown in Table 1. January was colder by ~3 °C compared to February and March. Since the whole campaign was carried out in the humid period, the RH was high. The visibility was at its lowest in January due to frequent fog/haze episodes, and its highest in February. Moreover, monthly-mean PM2.5 concentrations were the highest in January, while the lowest concentrations were recorded in February, probably
Summary
To identify the factors affecting air pollution, this study analyzed the relationship between multi-scale meteorological conditions and pollution events during the winter 2019. The mean PM2.5 concentration during the campaign that took place in Hanoi from 11/01 to 22/03/2019 was 45 ± 25 μg m −3. The highest daily level of PM2.5 was recorded on 25/01 (129 μg m−3), while lower levels of PM2.5 were mainly observed in February.
Four severely pollution events were recorded during the campaign,

Conversely, low PM2.5 concentrations were observed during the summer monsoon, dominated by southeast or southwest winds. This monitoring was consistent with recent studies of PM2.5 levels in Hanoi (Ngoc et al., 2021, Ly et al., 2021; Bui et al., 2022; Vuong et al., 2023). The average annual concentration (40.2 ± 26.3 μg m−3) was 1.6 and 8.0 times higher than the national standard (25 μg m−3; QCVN 05:2013/BTNMT) and the World Health Organization guidelines (5 μg m−3; WHO, 2021), respectively.

These fine particles from combustion sources also contain carcinogenic organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other toxic elements (e.g., arsenic, cadmium, lead) that increase health risks (Holme et al., 2019). In addition to health effects, particulate pollution leads to haze formation and decreases visibility (Ngoc et al., 2021). Finally, particulate matter (PM) affects the climate, especially the black carbon (BC) particles emitted from incomplete combustion can increase global warming (Ramanathan and Carmichael, 2008).
