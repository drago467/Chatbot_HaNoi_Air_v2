**Year:** 2020
**Journal:** Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-11729-2020
**Tier:** Tier 1

### Key Findings:

1. **Aerosol pH vertical gradient:**
   - Surface layer pH in Beijing: ~5.4
   - pH remained ~5 up to ~2 km above ground
   - pH rapidly increased to ~0 at ~3 km altitude
   - Pattern of aerosol acidity increasing with altitude persisted over NCP

2. **Regional pH variations:**
   - North of ~41°N: mean pH > 6, O3 oxidation pathway dominant
   - South of ~41°N: mean pH 4.4-5.7, different chemical regimes

3. **Sulfate formation pathways (pH-dependent):**
   - **NO2 pathway:** Dominant in Beijing megacity region, Hebei Province (pH > 4.5)
   - **TMI pathway:** Dominant in inland and coastal regions west/east of Beijing
   - **H2O2 pathway:** Dominant in Shandong and Henan provinces (pH < 4.5)
   - **O3 pathway:** More important at higher altitudes

4. **Key mechanism quotes:**
   - "depending on the aerosol pH and pollutant compositions, the major multiphase oxidation pathways may change from reactions of NO2 and O3 at pH greater than 4.5 to O2 (catalyzed by transition metal ion, TMI) and H2O2 at pH less than 4.5"
   - "the rapid production of sulfate in the NCP can be maintained over a wide range of aerosol acidity (e.g., pH = 4.2–5.7) with transitions from dominant TMI pathway regimes to dominant NO2/O3 pathway regimes"

5. **TMI sensitivity:**
   - Doubling TMI species sources almost triples sulfate production
   - Sulfate production is rather sensitive to TMI species availability

6. **Conditions:**
   - Winter haze conditions
   - High RH environment
   - North China Plain region

**Year:** 2021
**Journal:** Nature Communications
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22091-6
**Tier:** Tier 1

### Key Findings:

1. **Mn-catalyzed oxidation dominance:**

**Authors:** Xiaojuan Huang, Zhe Liu, Yanzhen Ge, Qing Li, Xiaofei Wang, et al.
**Year:** 2023
**Journal:** npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-023-00504-1
**Tier:** Tier 1

### Key Findings:

1. **Aerosol liquid water role:**
   - High aerosol water content promoted aging of EC-containing particles
   - Facilitated SOA formation from POAs
   - Under RH > 85%, multiphase oxidation of SO2 by in-particle nitrite/HONO enhanced

2. **Sulfate formation mechanisms under high LWC:**
   - At high LWC and pH > 5.5: aqueous oxidation by dissolved NO2 and HONO favored
   - At low LWC and pH 4-5: Mn-catalyzed oxidation on particle surfaces dominates
   - HMS formation significant under high RH conditions

3. **Quantitative observations:**
   - PM2.5 mass during high RH episodes: 2.0-4.3 times that during clean period
   - EC-containing particles: 62% average, up to 75% during high RH episodes
   - Aged EC-containing particles: 59% during Ep I (RH 88%) vs 16% during clean period

4. **Key quotes:**
   - "the synergistic effect of elevated aerosol water content and particles originating from fossil fuel combustion significantly enhanced the rapid formation of sulfate and SOAs under high humidity conditions"
   - "Under conditions of relative humidity exceeding 85%, the multiphase oxidation of SO2 by in-particle nitrite/nitrous acid...led to a substantial increase in sulfate production"

5. **Conditions:**
   - Winter in northern China (Tai'an city)
   - RH ranging from 32% (clean) to 88% (pollution episodes)
   - Temperature: winter conditions

## Paper 4: He et al. 2014 - Scientific Reports
**Title:** Mineral dust and NOx promote the conversion of SO2 to sulfate in heavy pollution days
**Authors:** Hong He, Yuesi Wang, Qingxin Ma, Jinzhu Ma, Biwu Chu, Dongsheng Ji, Guiqian Tang, Chang Liu, Hongxing Zhang & Jiming Hao
**Year:** 2014
**Journal:** Scientific Reports
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1038/srep04172
**Tier:** Tier 1

### Key Findings:

1. **Synergistic effect of NO2 and SO2 on mineral dust:**
   - NO2 and SO2 have synergistic effects when reacting on mineral dust surfaces
   - Coexistence of NO2 significantly promotes oxidation of surface sulfite to sulfate
   - O2 is the key oxidant in SO2 oxidation process

2. **Mechanism:**
   - Sulfate cannot form on CaO, Al2O3, ZnO, TiO2 without oxidant under synthetic air
   - On Fe2O3 and MgO surfaces, SO2 alone can produce sulfate
   - Coexistence of NO2 further increases sulfate amount on all surfaces
   - Surface sulfite species reduced or disappeared when NO2 + SO2 coexist

3. **Field observations:**
   - Five severe haze episodes in January 2013 in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei
   - PM2.5 peak concentrations over 300 μg/m³
   - Dust storm occurred from January 10-15, providing mineral dust surfaces

4. **Key quotes:**
   - "coexistence with NOx can reduce the environmental capacity for SO2, leading to rapid conversion of SO2 to sulfate because NO2 and SO2 have a synergistic effect when they react on the surface of mineral dust"
   - "the formation of sulfate was found to be a main reason for the growth of fine particles"

5. **Implications:**
   - Combined air pollution from motor vehicles and coal-fired emissions reduces atmospheric capacity for SO2
   - Impact of motor vehicle exhaust may be underestimated

## Paper 5: Xu et al. 2020 - ACP
**Title:** Importance of gas-particle partitioning of ammonia in haze formation in the rural agricultural environment
**Authors:** Jian Xu, Jia Chen, Na Zhao, Guochen Wang, Guangyuan Yu, Hao Li, et al.
**Year:** 2020
**Journal:** Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-7259-2020
**Tier:** Tier 1

### Key Findings:

1. **Gas-particle partitioning of ammonia (ε(NH4+)):**
   - ε(NH4+), not ammonia concentrations, plays critical role in SNA formation during haze
   - AWC plays predominant regulating role for ε(NH4+)
   - Self-amplifying feedback mechanism associated with ε(NH4+) for SNA formation

2. **Factors affecting ε(NH4+):**
   - Temperature (T)
   - Aerosol water content (AWC)
   - Aerosol pH
   - Activity coefficient

3. **Observations:**
   - Exceedingly high agricultural ammonia levels: ~30 µg m-3
   - NH3 promotes new particle formation in nucleation and growth
   - SO2 oxidation enhanced by presence of NH3

4. **Key quotes:**
   - "gas-particle partitioning of ammonia (ε(NH4+)), as opposed to ammonia concentrations, plays a critical role in SNA formation during the haze period"
   - "AWC plays predominant regulating roles for ε(NH4+)"
   - "a reduction in ammonia emissions alone may not reduce SNA effectively"

5. **Self-amplifying feedback loop:**
   - Higher AWC → Higher ε(NH4+) → More SNA formation → More AWC
   - Consistent with diurnal variations in ε(NH4+), AWC, and SNA

**Authors:** Jian Wang et al.
**Year:** 2021
**Journal:** Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2022179118
**Tier:** Tier 1

### Key Findings:

1. **Aqueous-phase SOA formation mechanism:**
   - Fast aqueous-phase oxidation of directly emitted POA occurs at high RH
   - Ring-breaking oxidation of POA aromatic species (PAHs)
   - Functionalization as carbonyls and carboxylic acids

2. **Quantitative effects:**
   - Aqueous-phase conversion of FF-POA to SOA accounts for ~20% of total OA in haze
   - Most SOA originates from fossil-fuel combustion
   - OA accounts for ~50% of total PM2.5 in winter haze

3. **Conditions:**
   - Stage I: RH 53 ± 12%, T = 277 K
   - Stage II: RH 81 ± 10%, T = 274 K (high humidity, cooler)
   - Low cloud and fog pervasive at night during Stage II

4. **Key quotes:**
   - "fast aqueous-phase oxidation of directly emitted primary organic aerosol (POA) takes place at high relative humidity in Beijing winter haze and can explain the observed SOA"
   - "ring-breaking oxidation and functionalization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons"

5. **Implications:**
   - SOA decreased in response to POA emission controls even as VOC emissions stayed flat
   - Conversion of FF-POA to aq-SOA decreases light absorption of OA
