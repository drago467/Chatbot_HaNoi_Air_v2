- **URL**: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S135223102300095X
- **Tier**: tier_1
- **Relevance Score**: 10
- **Key Findings**: Long-range transport from China during cold surge onset causes ~30% increase in PM2.5 in Hanoi. Stagnation of local pollution during cold surge persistence causes ~40% increase in PM2.5. Dominant sources switched from biomass burning to industrial activities. El-Niño episodes affect aerosol loads and types.

### Paper 3: Su et al. (2018)

- **Year**: 2018
- **Journal**: Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics
- **Volume/Pages**: 18, 15921–15935
- **DOI**: 10.5194/acp-18-15921-2018
- **URL**: https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/15921/2018/
- **Tier**: tier_1
- **Relevance Score**: 9
- **Key Findings**: PBLH-PM correlations are roughly negative for most cases. Nonlinearly negative responses of PM to PBLH evolution found over polluted regions. Relatively strong PBLH-PM interactions when PBLH is shallow and PM concentration is high (wintertime). Strong wind with clean upwind air plays dominant role in removing pollutants. Ventilation rate has largest impact on surface pollutant accumulation.

### Paper 4: Ashfold et al. (2017)
- **Title**: Influence of Northeast Monsoon cold surges on air quality in Southeast Asia
- **Authors**: Ashfold, M.J., Latif, M.T., Samah, A.A., Mead, M.I., Harris, N.R.P.
- **Year**: 2017
- **Journal**: Atmospheric Environment
- **Volume/Pages**: 166, 498-509
- **DOI**: 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.07.047
- **URL**: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135223101730496X
- **Tier**: tier_1
- **Relevance Score**: 9
- **Key Findings**: Cold surges in November-February transport East Asian pollution to Southeast Asia. CO and O3 elevated by >60% (~80 ppb) and >40% (~15 ppb) respectively during cold surges. Regional exceedances of WHO's O3 guideline often occur during cold surges. Year-to-year variations in cold surge activity related to ENSO.

### Paper 5: Wu et al. (2018)
- **Title**: Comparison of dry and wet deposition of particulate matter in near-surface waters during summer
- **Authors**: Wu, Y., Liu, J., Zhai, J., Cong, L., Wang, Y., Ma, W., Zhang, Z., Li, C.
- **Year**: 2018
- **Journal**: PLoS One
- **Volume**: 13(6), e0199241
- **DOI**: 10.1371/journal.pone.0199241
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6013115/
- **Tier**: tier_1
- **Relevance Score**: 8
- **Key Findings**: Wet deposition was more effective in scavenging PM2.5 (92% efficiency). Dry deposition more effective for PM10 (63%). Wet deposition accounted for 54-71% of PM1-20 deposition. Rain scavenging takes place via Brownian diffusion, inertial impaction, diffusiophoresis, thermophoresis. Rainfall intensity and PM diameter influence wet deposition efficiency.
