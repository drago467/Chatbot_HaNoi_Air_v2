## Key Findings

### Mechanism: Cloud Cover → Temperature Inversion → PM2.5
1. **Decreased cloud cover → Enhanced surface radiation cooling**:
   - "Surface radiation cooling was enhanced (weakened) by decreased (increased) cloud cover fraction by changing longwave radiation at night"
   
2. **Enhanced radiation cooling → Strengthened temperature inversion**:
   - "this strengthened (weakened) near-surface temperature inversion intensity"
   
3. **Strengthened inversion → PM2.5 accumulation**:
   - "promoted (prevented) the accumulated increase in PM2.5"

### Key Quotes
- "Nighttime elevated PM2.5 levels occur primarily under the condition of strong surface radiation cooling."
- "Surface radiation cooling is enhanced by a decrease in cloud cover promoting an increase in PM2.5."
- "A mechanism for the cloud effect on PM2.5 pollution at night is revealed."
- "significant negative correlation between nighttime averages of surface PM2.5 concentrations and cloud cover fractions"

### Conditions
- **Time**: Nighttime (20:00 to 8:00)
- **Season**: Winter
- **Location**: Sichuan Basin, Southwest China (basin topography similar to Hanoi)

### Causal Chain Extracted
1. `decreased_cloud_cover` → `enhanced_longwave_radiation_loss` → `surface_radiation_cooling`
2. `surface_radiation_cooling` → `temperature_inversion` (strengthened)
3. `temperature_inversion` → `reduced_vertical_mixing` → `pm25` (accumulation)

### Daytime vs Nighttime Effects
- **Daytime clouds**: "scatter and reflect solar radiation, resulting in a net cooling effect on the surface, which depresses convective PBL development and promotes PM2.5 accumulation"
- **Nighttime clouds**: "have a net warming effect on the surface owing to trap longwave radiation emitted by the surface and radiate it back downward"
