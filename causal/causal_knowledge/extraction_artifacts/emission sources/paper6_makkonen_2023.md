## Key Findings

### PM2.5 Concentrations
- Annual average: 49 μg/m³ (traffic site), 46 μg/m³ (general urban site)
- Exceeded Vietnam national standard (25 μg/m³)
- Exceeded WHO 2021 guideline (5 μg/m³)
- Highest concentrations during winter (stagnant meteorological conditions)

### PM2.5 Composition
- 50% organic matter (40% attributable to biomass burning)
- 33% secondary inorganic aerosol (dominated by sulphate)
- Elemental carbon higher at traffic site (halved during COVID-19 lockdown)

### Source Apportionment (PMF Analysis)
Six source factors identified:
1. **Traffic**: 12%
2. **Local Secondary Inorganic Aerosol (SIA)**: 18%
3. **Biomass burning**: 19%
4. **Industry**: 9%
5. **Long-range transported SIA**: 25%
6. **Dust**: 17%

### Key Quotes for Extraction

**Multiple Sources**:
> "It appeared that scattered open waste and biomass burning, as well as coal combustion, are important sources causing spikes of PM2.5 pollution in Hanoi above the general levels caused by routine industrial and traffic sources, especially during stagnant winter days."

**Biomass Burning**:
> "Half of the resolved mass was organic matter, of which about 40% was attributable to biomass burning, most likely rice straw field burning and domestic fuel combustion."

**Coal Combustion**:
> "One third of PM2.5 was secondary inorganic aerosol which was dominated by sulphate hence indicating a high contribution of stationary sources like coal combustion."

**Industrial Sources**:
> "Zinc was the most common trace element with high daily variations and large differences between the sites, and it often peaked with Cd, Cl− and Pb indicating contribution of industrial sources and/or coal combustion."

**Open Waste Burning**:
> "The highest zinc concentrations appeared on a few days and likely originated from open burning of municipal solid waste."

**COVID-19 Impact on Traffic**:
> "The elemental carbon level was higher at the traffic site, except in April 2020 during the COVID-19 restrictions."
