The percentage (%) represent the proportion of the average TB PM2.5 entering each province, calculated by comparing between Case 1 and Case 3 for each provincial boundary.

Among the individual months, March displayed the highest TB PM2.5 concentrations throughout the study period. Chiang Rai province consistently exhibited the most significant TB PM2.5 concentrations, averaging 86.53 µg/m3. This value constitutes 68% of the overall TB PM2.5 average, indicating that a substantial portion of Chiang Rai’s PM2.5 originates from transboundary sources. Notably, Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son, Phayao, and Nan provinces also displayed TB PM2.5 proportions exceeding 40%. Conversely, Lamphun province exhibited the lowest average TB PM2.5 concentration (15.36 µg/m3), representing only 35% of its total PM2.5. February and April displayed similar TB PM2.5 levels, with Chiang Rai and Mae Hong Son provinces demonstrating the highest concentrations (approximately 30%) compared to other provinces. January witnessed comparatively lower TB PM2.5 levels; however, Tak province experienced a significant increase in TB PM2.5, exceeding other provinces and accounting for 31%. Finally, May exhibited the lowest TB PM2.5 concentrations across all provinces, although Chiang Rai province consistently maintained the highest level.

The model output was analyzed as grid data, and the average concentration of TB PM2.5 for each province within the study area was depicted in box plots (Figure 5). These plots indicate that Chiang Rai exhibits the highest average TB PM2.5 concentrations. This province also demonstrates large spatial variation but lacks outlier values. In contrast, other provinces exhibit narrower ranges between their maximum and minimum TB PM2.5 concentrations, suggesting greater consistency within each province. However, it is notable that outliers are prevalent in several provinces, particularly Chiang Mai and Nan, where numerous extreme outliers occur. This implies that localized areas within these provinces experience significantly higher TB PM2.5 exposure than the provincial average. Lampang, Mae Hong Son, Phayao, and Tak display mild outliers, indicating some localized areas of elevated TB PM2.5 concentrations. Conversely, Lamphun and Phrae lack outliers, with minimal differences between their maximum and minimum values, suggesting a lower overall TB PM2.5 burden compared to the other provinces analyzed.

When considering the monthly average, January showed that TB PM2.5 crossed into the study area lightly. In most provinces, the amount of TB PM2.5 was not significantly different, and mild outlier values were detected in some areas. However, in Tak, the amount of TB PM2.5 was notably elevated, indicating a significant disparity compared to other provinces.

In February, an increase in TB PM2.5 was observed across all provinces. Notably, Chiang Rai exhibited the highest TB PM2.5 concentrations and a wide range of values. In Chiang Mai, several outliers were detected, approaching the maximum values observed in Chiang Rai. However, the majority of TB PM2.5 in Chiang Mai remained lower compared to other provinces. Mae Hong Son displayed the second-highest TB PM2.5 concentrations after Chiang Rai, with significant variations in value range. In contrast, most other provinces exhibited consistent TB PM2.5 concentrations, with a few outliers.

An analysis of TB PM2.5 concentrations during the crisis haze period in March revealed significant inter-provincial variations. Chiang Rai exhibited the highest levels, characterized by a notably wide range of values. Mae Hong Son followed with the second-highest TB PM2.5, also displaying a large value range. Both Chiang Mai and Nan experienced numerous severe outliers, some reaching Chiang Rai’s average value. Phayao recorded TB PM2.5 concentrations comparable to Mae Hong Son, exhibiting a consistent range with minimal outliers. Conversely, the remaining provinces displayed lower TB PM2.5 levels, with Tak being the only exception, exhibiting both severe and mild outliers.

In April, the TB PM2.5 levels and trends were consistent with those observed in March. Chiang Rai maintained the highest TB PM2.5 concentrations, characterized by a severe outlier and the most significant variation in values. Subsequently, Tak, Mae Hong Son, Nan, Chiang Mai, and Phayao followed in terms of TB PM2.5 concentrations. Notably, Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son, and Nan experienced frequent occurrences of severe outliers, while Lampang, Lamphun, and Phrae consistently recorded substantially lower TB PM2.5 concentrations.

May exhibited the lowest impact from TB PM2.5 throughout the study period, coinciding with the end of the haze season. However, Chiang Rai consistently recorded the highest TB PM2.5 concentrations, demonstrating a significant deviation in values compared to other provinces. Nan followed with the second-highest TB PM2.5 concentrations. Notably, both Nan and Chiang Mai displayed a small number of severe outliers. Conversely, the remaining provinces experienced comparatively minimal TB PM2.5 concentrations within their respective provinces.

3.4. Impacts of Transboundary Biomass Burning PM2.5 on Local Air Quality and Public Health

Based on the number of days characterized by the presence of transboundary biomass burning PM2.5 (TB PM2.5) across the 10 monitoring stations throughout the study period spanning 152 days, the report analyzes the occurrence of TB PM2.5 concentrations exceeding various thresholds across designated stations (Figure 6). The details are as follows.

Figure 6.

Number of days affected by transboundary (TB) PM2.5 at 10 PCD monitoring stations based on specified criteria. The darker red shaded indicates the greater number of days.

Criteria 1: PM2.5 Concentration > 35.4 µg/m3 (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups)

At 25% TB PM2.5, all stations consistently exceed the 35.4 µg/m3 threshold for a minimum of 31 days. Stations 57t (Chiang Rai) and 58t (Mae Hong Son) experience the longest durations, exceeding this threshold for over 60 days. Stations 67t (Nan), 69t (Phrae), 70t (Phayao), and 76t (Tak) follow with occurrences exceeding 40 days. Stations 35t–36t (Chiang Mai), 37t (Lampang), and 68t (Lamphun) show exceedances for around 30 days. For 50% TB PM2.5, this trend of consistent exceedance persists for all stations, with station 58t leading with 45 days and station 57t recording 33 days. Stations 67t, 69t, 70t, and 76t report approximately 10 days, while other stations exhibit fewer occurrences. As the threshold increases to 75% and 90%, the number of stations experiencing exceedances significantly decreases. Only stations 57t and 58t report occurrences, with durations of 9 and 11 days for 75%, respectively, and only station 57t recorded 1 day for 90%. When TB PM2.5 concentrations reach the Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups levels (>35.4 µg/m3), all stations experience a TB PM2.5 influence exceeding 25% for at least 31 days. Stations 57t and 58t exhibit consistently higher occurrences across all thresholds. Station 57t is the only station to experience TB PM2.5 exceeding 90%.

Criteria 2: TB PM2.5 Concentration > 55.4 µg/m3 (Unhealthy)

For PM2.5 proportions exceeding 25%, this pattern is observed at all stations. Notably, stations 57t and 58t emerged as focal points, recording 43 and 32 days, respectively. A similar trend was found at stations 67t and 70t, reaching 21 days. The remaining stations recorded approximately 10 days meeting this criterion, with station 76t registering a single instance. When considering the criterion of exceeding 50% TB PM2.5, this pattern was predominantly noted at all stations for less than 10 days. However, stations 57t and 58t again demonstrated elevated occurrences, enduring 29 and 31 days, respectively. As the threshold increased to 75%, occurrences were confined to stations 57t and 58t, with 9 and 11 days, respectively. At the 90% threshold, only station 57t exhibited a single day of this influence. This analysis underscores that all stations experienced continuous TB PM2.5 influence when TB PM2.5 concentrations reached Unhealthy levels (exceeding 50% for at least 1 day for all stations). Stations 57t and 58t stood out with significantly higher percentages, with station 57t being the sole station exceeding the 90% threshold.

Criteria 3: PM2.5 Concentration > 150.4 µg/m3 (Very Unhealthy)

Our analysis revealed that stations 57t and 67t displayed notable exceedances of this TB PM2.5 concentration threshold. Specifically, station 57t experienced 9 days where TB PM2.5 exceeded 25% of the total PM2.5 concentration, while station 67t recorded a single day. When considering the stricter threshold of 75% TB PM2.5, only station 57t exhibited occurrences, with a total of 6 days. Similarly, at the 90% threshold, only station 57t recorded a single day with such elevated influence. These findings highlight the consistently significant impact of TB PM2.5 at station 57t, especially during periods of Very Unhealthy levels. While station 67t also demonstrated a relatively high percentage of exceedances, its impact was notably less pronounced compared to station 57t. This analysis highlights the significant influence of transboundary biomass burning PM2.5 on local air quality and public health, particularly in specific monitoring stations that experienced high levels of exceedances.

4. Discussion
WRF-Chem Model Evaluation

Our analysis of transboundary biomass burning PM2.5 (TB PM2.5) across 10 monitoring stations over a 152-day study period revealed significant spatial and temporal variations in PM2.5 concentrations. Chiang Rai province consistently exhibited the highest average TB PM2.5 concentrations, with substantial spatial variation but few outliers. Mae Hong Son also demonstrated high TB PM2.5 levels with significant variation. Conversely, Lamphun and Phrae recorded the lowest TB PM2.5 concentrations, with minimal differences between maximum and minimum values and no outliers. Notably, stations 57t (Chiang Rai) and 58t (Mae Hong Son) frequently exceeded health-relevant thresholds, particularly at the higher concentration criteria.

The findings indicate that transboundary biomass burning significantly impacts air quality in Northern Thailand, with certain provinces experiencing notably higher PM2.5 levels. This has important implications for regional air quality management and public health policies, highlighting the need for targeted interventions in the most affected areas. The consistent exceedances of health-relevant PM2.5 thresholds underscore the urgency of addressing transboundary pollution sources and implementing effective mitigation strategies.

Our results align with previous research, indicating the significant impact of transboundary biomass burning on air quality in Southeast Asia [32,33,34]. Similar studies have documented high levels of PM2.5 during biomass burning events, with substantial contributions from transboundary sources [35]. A study by Betha et al. (2013) [36] reported that biomass burning in Southeast Asia contributed significantly to PM2.5 concentrations in downwind regions, consistent with the spatial patterns observed in our study. More recent studies continue to support these findings. Additional studies also highlight the severe health impacts of PM2.5 from biomass burning. For instance, Karanasiou et al. (2021), Basith et al. (2022), and Krittanawong et al. (2023) [37,38,39] reported the toxicological effects of PM2.5 in affected populations, showing a clear link between biomass burning events and increased respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Reducing biomass burning is essential to decrease PM2.5 exposure in many regions, including Europe [40], the United States [41], China [42], Southeast Asia [43], and northern Thailand [44]. This reduction is critical for mitigating health impacts associated with PM2.5 pollution.

One limitation of our study is the reliance on data from only 10 monitoring stations, which may not fully capture the spatial heterogeneity of TB PM2.5 across the entire region. Additionally, the study period of 152 days may not encompass the full variability of biomass burning events throughout the year. The use of model simulations, while robust, also introduces uncertainties related to model parameters and input data.

Despite these limitations, our study has several strengths. The comprehensive analysis of TB PM2.5 concentrations across multiple thresholds provides a detailed understanding of the pollution levels and their health implications. The use of grid data and box plots allows for a nuanced assessment of spatial and temporal variations, enhancing the robustness of our findings. Furthermore, the focus on transboundary pollution highlights an important environmental issue that requires coordinated regional efforts to address.

The public health implications of our findings are significant. Prolonged exposure to high levels of PM2.5, especially from biomass burning, is associated with adverse health outcomes, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The high concentrations of TB PM2.5 observed in Chiang Rai and Mae Hong Son suggest a heightened risk for residents in these areas. Policymakers need to prioritize air quality management and public health interventions in these regions to mitigate the impact of transboundary biomass burning on local communities.

5. Conclusions

Our study reveals significant spatial and temporal variations in transboundary biomass burning PM2.5 (TB PM2.5) concentrations across northern Thailand, with Chiang Rai and Mae Hong Son provinces experiencing the highest levels. Stations 57t (Chiang Rai) and 58t (Mae Hong Son) frequently exceeded health-relevant PM2.5 thresholds, indicating a substantial public health risk. The findings align with previous research on the impact of transboundary biomass burning in Southeast Asia, emphasizing the need for targeted air quality management and regional collaboration to mitigate these effects and protect public health.
