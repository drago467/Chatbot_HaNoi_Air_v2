## Key Findings

### SOA Formation Mechanism
1. **Isoprene → SOA pathway**:
   - Mean SOA mass yield: **3.3%** from isoprene oxidation
   - Two main pathways depending on NOx levels:
     - **Low-NOx pathway**: ISOPO2 + HO2 → IEPOX → SOA (58% of isoprene SOA)
     - **High-NOx pathway**: ISOPO2 + NO → glyoxal → SOA (28% of isoprene SOA)

2. **IEPOX (Isoprene Epoxydiols)**:
   - Primary precursor for isoprene SOA under low-NOx conditions
   - Contributes 58% of total isoprene SOA
   - Aqueous-phase processing on acidic particles

3. **Glyoxal pathway**:
   - Contributes 28% of isoprene SOA
   - Active under both low- and high-NOx conditions

### Conditions for SOA Formation
- **Aerosol acidity**: Strong relationship between IEPOX SOA and sulfate aerosol
- **Sulfate effect**: Affects aerosol acidity and volume, enhancing SOA formation
- **Humidity**: Aerosol is prevailingly aqueous under humid conditions typical of isoprene-emitting regions

### Quantitative Effects
- NOx decrease → 7% increase in isoprene SOA (favors low-NOx pathway)
- SO2 decrease (48%) → 35% decrease in isoprene SOA
- Factor of 2 co-benefit for PM2.5 from SO2 emission controls

## Relevant Quotes
> "Isoprene SOA production is mainly contributed by two immediate gas-phase precursors, isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX, 58 % of isoprene SOA) from the low-NOx pathway and glyoxal (28 %) from both low- and high-NOx pathways."

> "We find a mean SOA mass yield of 3.3 % from isoprene oxidation, consistent with the observed relationship of total fine organic aerosol (OA) and formaldehyde."

> "Observations show a strong relationship between IEPOX SOA and sulfate aerosol that we explain as due to the effect of sulfate on aerosol acidity and volume."

## Applicability to Hanoi/Vietnam
- Southeast Asia has high isoprene emissions from tropical vegetation
- High humidity conditions favor aqueous-phase SOA formation
- Monsoon climate similar to conditions studied
