## Key Findings

### Cold Surge Effects on PM2.5

**Highlight Quote 1**: "During cold surge onsets, long-range transport from China causes an average increase of ∼30% in PM2.5 concentrations."

**Highlight Quote 2**: "The stagnation of local pollution during the cold surges persistence causes an average increase of ∼40% in level of PM2.5."

### Mechanisms Identified

#### 1. Cold Surge Onset Phase
- Northeast monsoon brings cold air masses from China
- Air masses travel through industrialized eastern China
- Long-range transport (LRT) of pollutants to Hanoi
- ~30% increase in PM2.5 during onset

#### 2. Cold Surge Persistence Phase  
- Stagnant meteorological conditions
- Local pollution accumulates
- ~40% increase in PM2.5 during persistence
- Most severe pollution episodes occur during this phase

### Seasonal Source Patterns

#### Period 2006-2011
- Main source: Biomass burning over Indochina Peninsula
- Smoke partial AOD dominant

#### Period 2011-2020
- Main source: Coal-based industrial activities in eastern China and northern Vietnam
- Sulfate partial AOD dominant
- Related to rapid growth of thermal power plants (TPPs) in Red River Delta

### El Niño Effects
- El Niño episodes (2014/15, 2015/16, 2018/19) changed air mass trajectories
- More western air masses instead of northeastern
- Temporary decrease in sulfate AOD
- Increase in smoke AOD (biomass burning influence)

### Winter Period Definition
- October to March
- 10-15 Northeast monsoon cold surges per winter
- Northeast monsoon cycles create periodic changes in:
  - Air mass pathways
  - Meteorological conditions

### Local vs Remote Sources
- During high pollution events: 57% local, 43% non-local
- During lower pollution periods: 42% local, 58% non-local
- Long-range transport from China significant contributor

## Relevant Quotes for Extraction

1. "During the winter period (October to March), air quality in northern Vietnam is strongly impacted by the northeast monsoon cycles, that create periodic changes in the air masses pathways and the meteorological conditions."

2. "Long-range transport from China during the onset of cold surges caused an average increase of around 30% of the PM2.5 level in Hanoi."

3. "The contribution of local pollution to the most severe pollution episodes, occurring during the persistence of cold surges, was estimated to be around 40% of the average PM2.5."

4. "The dominant sources of winter air pollution in Hanoi switched from biomass burning to industrial activities."
