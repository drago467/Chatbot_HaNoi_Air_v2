## Key Findings for Static Factors

### Industrial Agglomeration - PM2.5 Relationship
**Quote 1**: "The spatial agglomeration of high-pollution factories aggravated PM2.5 pollution in 1998-2013."
- Source: Highlights

**Quote 2**: "The empirical analysis of the spatial panel model shows that the spatial agglomeration of high-pollution factories in China aggravated PM2.5 pollution, while the negative impact was reduced or even absent in Eastern China and urban agglomerations due to the higher level of economic development and effective management."
- Source: Abstract

**Quote 3**: "The industrial sector accounts for roughly 30% of total PM2.5 pollution in China, and more than 90% of the industrial sector pollution comes from high-pollution industries."
- Source: Introduction

### Mechanism Explanation
From Introduction:
1. Industrial agglomeration accompanied by increasing resource consumption and pollutant emissions
2. Factories agglomerate in specific regions tend to adopt "environmental free-riding" strategy
3. Local governments may lower environmental regulatory standards to attract factories
4. Some industrial parks have become seriously polluted areas

### Regional Heterogeneity
- Negative externalities of spatial agglomeration are much lower in Eastern China and urban agglomerations
- Due to higher level of economic development and effective management

### Temporal Pattern
- High-pollution factories in China in 1998-2013 were increasingly scattered in space
- Fastest growth in number of factories was mainly at administrative junctions of provinces and cities
- Trend of high-pollution factories shifting from districts to counties

### Factory Scatter Index (FSI)
- Measures average distance between high-pollution factories
- Higher FSI indicates more scattered degree of factories
- Spatial panel model used for analysis

## Relevant for Relationships
1. **industrial_zones_agglomeration → pm25** (INDIRECT_CAUSE)
   - Mechanism: Spatial agglomeration of high-pollution factories increases PM2.5 through concentrated industrial emissions, environmental free-riding, and relaxed environmental standards
   - Industrial sector accounts for ~30% of total PM2.5 pollution in China
   - >90% of industrial sector pollution comes from high-pollution industries
   - Strength: STRONG
   - Confidence: HIGH
   - Spatial scope: regional (prefecture-level)
   - Moderating factors: Economic development level and management effectiveness reduce negative impact
