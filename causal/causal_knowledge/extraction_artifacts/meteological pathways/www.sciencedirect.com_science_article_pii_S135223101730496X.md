Abstract
Ozone (O3) is an important ground-level pollutant. O3 levels and emissions of O3 precursors have increased significantly over recent decades in East Asia and export of this O3 eastward across the Pacific Ocean is well documented. Here we show that East Asian O3 is also transported southward to tropical Southeast (SE) Asia during the Northeast Monsoon (NEM) season (defined as November to February), and that this transport pathway is especially strong during ‘cold surges’. Our analysis employs reanalysis data and measurements from surface sites in Peninsular Malaysia, both covering 2003–2012, along with trajectory calculations. Using a cold surge index (northerly winds at 925 hPa averaged over 105–110°E, 5°N) to define sub-seasonal strengthening of the NEM winds, we find the largest changes in a region covering much of the Indochinese Peninsula and surrounding seas. Here, the levels of O3 and another key pollutant, carbon monoxide, calculated by the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) Reanalysis are on average elevated by, respectively, >40% (∼15 ppb) and >60% (∼80 ppb) during cold surges. Further, in the broader region of SE Asia local afternoon exceedances of the World Health Organization's air quality guideline for O3 (100 μg m−3, or ∼50 ppb, averaged over 8 h) largely occur during these cold surges. Day-to-day variations in available O3 observations at surface sites on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia and in corresponding parts of the MACC Reanalysis are similar, and are clearly linked to cold surges. However, observed O3 levels are typically ∼10–20 ppb lower than the MACC Reanalysis. We show that these observations are also subject to influence from local urban pollution. In agreement with past work, we find year-to-year variations in cold surge activity related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), but this does not appear to be the dominant influence of ENSO on atmospheric composition in this region. Overall, our study indicates that the influence of East Asian pollution on air quality in SE Asia during the NEM could be at least as large as the corresponding, well-studied spring-time influence on North America. Both an enhanced regional observational capability and chemical modelling studies will be required to fully untangle the importance of this long-range influence relative to local processes.
Introduction
Ground-level ozone (O3) has important impacts on human health (Lelieveld et al., 2015), and these impacts are likely to be large throughout the 21st century (Silva et al., 2016). In the tropical boundary layer there are year-to-year variations in O3 linked to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which modifies chemical and transport processes, and drives changes in emissions of O3 precursors (e.g. Inness et al., 2015, Hou et al., 2016). However, Ziemke et al. (2015) reported that variability in tropical tropospheric O3 is primarily driven by shorter timescale (non-ENSO) phenomena. One such form of shorter-timescale variation is East Asian ‘cold surges’, characterised by periodic strengthening of the prevailing north-easterly winds during the northern hemisphere (NH) winter monsoon (or Northeast Monsoon, NEM), that have been studied for decades in a meteorological context (e.g. Chang et al., 1979, Zhang et al., 1997). However, while past work (e.g. Liu et al., 2003, Wang et al., 2016) has examined the influence of cold surges on atmospheric composition away from the tropics, their importance for the tropics has received little attention.
This tropical impact could be large as during NH winter high levels of mid-latitude pollution found in East Asia (e.g. Stein et al., 2014) are matched with unusually strong northerly winds towards the equator. There is clearly great potential for significant transport of pollution to the deep tropics within this particular range of longitudes, and this is particularly true during cold surge events. For example, using trajectory calculations and observations for one NH winter Ashfold et al. (2015) showed that cold surges could rapidly (over a few days) transport polluted air masses from East Asia to tropical Southeast (SE) Asia. Oram et al. (2017) present further measurements and model results which demonstrate the likely importance of this mechanism for transporting large quantities of short-lived chlorinated compounds, with the capacity to deplete stratospheric O3, from East Asian emission sources to the tropics.
Yet the spatial and temporal extent to which these cold surges affect air quality, including O3 levels, in SE Asia is not clear. It is well known that pollution originating in East Asia and transported eastward leads to elevated O3 levels above the North Pacific Ocean and in North America (e.g. Wild and Akimoto, 2001, Liu et al., 2003, Zhang et al., 2008, Cooper et al., 2010, Lin et al., 2012, Lin et al., 2014, Verstraeten et al., 2015), and so an equivalent impact in SE Asia linked to cold surges might be expected. Such an impact is hinted at by Ashfold et al. (2015) who showed that cold surges could increase O3, as well as carbon monoxide (CO), another harmful gas that is often used as a marker for anthropogenic pollution, to approximately double the levels typically found in the ‘clean’ background atmosphere over the relatively short (∼weeks-months) period covered by their analysis.
In this study we investigate more thoroughly the relationship between cold surges and SE Asian air quality, with a particular focus on O3, using longer-term datasets. We describe various aspects of our methodology in Section 2. In Section 3.1 we provide a climatological background, and in Section 3.2 we characterize our cold surge index. Then in Section 3.3 we 1) use this index to explore air quality composites for cold surge and non-cold surge conditions, 2) use dispersion model calculations to further investigate the link between cold surges and high levels of pollution, and 3) consider the importance of cold surges in driving exceedances of air quality thresholds in our study region on a day-to-day basis. In Section 3.4 we compare reanalysis data with observations from surface sites. Our final analysis, in Section 3.5, focuses on whether the known influence of ENSO on cold surge activity is an important driver of year-to-year variations in pollution in SE Asia. Section 4 contains a discussion of our key findings.

Reanalysis data
Much of our analysis relies on the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) Reanalysis of atmospheric composition (Inness et al., 2013), which has been used successfully in studies of the tropical atmosphere (e.g. Inness et al., 2015, Ashfold et al., 2015). We extracted O3, CO and meridional wind (v) data for each November, December, January and February (NDJF) in the 10 year period covered by the dataset (2003–2012). We analyse time-steps at 06:00 and 18:00 Universal Time (UT), or 
Seasonal variations in atmospheric composition in SE Asia
To set the context for our analysis, we first examine seasonal differences in SE Asia for selected variables in the MACC Reanalysis. Fig. 1 shows a climatology of CO, O3 and v for NH winter (here using the common definition of the season, DJF) in SE Asia. For comparison, NH summer (JJA) climatologies and the differences between the two seasons for the same variables are also shown. In NH winter the strong (northerly component faster than 6 m s−1) north-easterly monsoon winds over the SCS are an 
Discussion and conclusions
Our analysis of MACC Reanalysis data, along with the supporting trajectory calculations, has shown that NEM cold surges have a significant impact on aspects of air quality in SE Asia. The largest impact is in a region covering much of the Indochinese Peninsula and surrounding seas, where CO and O3 are elevated by, respectively, >60% (∼80 ppb) and >40% (∼15 ppb), during ‘average’ cold surge conditions (using the V5 definition). In much of this area, and indeed also in the wider SE Asia region,

Further investigation to understand the relatively low correlation between DSO and NSO during the inter-monsoon seasons would perhaps provide some insight into the local contributions towards background ozone. Long-range transport of air pollution, including ozone, from Indochina during the boreal winter season has been described in detail within the South East Asia region by several researchers (Ashfold et al., 2017; Dominick et al., 2015; Khan et al., 2016; Latif et al., 2012). This phenomenon may affect the NSO concentrations in Malaysia too.

The average concentration of O3 was relatively high although the concentration values were below the maximum level recommended by RMAQG. High concentrations of O3 at this station can be associated with the high intensity of ultraviolet (UV) radiation in the tropical area and the existence of O3 precursors locally and from trans-boundary sources [55]. The presence of sunlight will induce the reaction of NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to form O3 in the ambient area [56, 57].
