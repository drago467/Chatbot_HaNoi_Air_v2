Abstract
Intensive monitoring for PM mass and composition was conducted during December 2006–February 2007 at a mixed site in Hanoi, Vietnam. Fluctuations in levels of 24 h PM2.5 (26–143 μg m−3) and PM10 (37–165 μg m−3) were examined in relation to weather conditions and regional synoptic patterns. High 24 h PM levels were observed at low wind speeds when a stagnating ridge governed over Northern Vietnam. Diurnal variations of PM mass and composition, analyzed using 4 h-samples, reflected the influence of local emissions with peaks of PM mass and EC/OC observed during morning and evening rush hours. The 24 h EC and OC levels in PM2.5, 1.5–4.9 μg m−3 and 10–39 μg m−3, respectively, constituted about 90% of the total EC and OC in PM10. Ionic species (

) and combustion (biomass, diesel, etc.) to PM2.5. PMF model revealed 7 source factors of PM2.5: secondary mixed PM (40%), diesel traffic (10%), residential/commercial cooking (16%), secondary sulfate rich (16%), aged seasalt mixed (11%), industry/incinerator (6%), and construction/soil (1%). Contributions from local emission sources and the potential long-range transport were analyzed using the PM compositions and the diurnal variations in relation to local source activities, location of local sources, winds and air mass HYSPLIT trajectories. Major part of PM2.5 mass appeared to link to local emission origins. Additional measurement data are required to characterize the weekend–weekday and inter-seasonal patterns of PM.
Highlights
► PM2.5 and PM10–2.5 were investigated during polluted winter period in Hanoi. ► Variation in PM mass and composition were analyzed with meteorology and emission. ► Reconstructed mass and PMF model were used for source identification and apportionment. ► Contribution of local sources and long range transport to PM2.5 were analyzed.
Introduction
Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is the most notable air pollution problem in developing Asian cities (Gupta et al., 2006; Tsai and Chen, 2006; Hopke et al., 2008; Kim Oanh et al., 2006). PM gets increasing attention because of the adverse effects on human health, the atmosphere and climate (Bond et al., 2004). The extent of these effects depends on PM size and compositions. Fine particles measured as PM2.5 (particles with the aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm) can penetrate the lungs deeper than large particles, hence are more damaging (Pope et al., 2009).
Systematic PM records, however, remain limited in Asian developing countries, especially for PM2.5. Until recently, available national monitoring networks focused more on the total suspended PM (TSP) but at present PM10 (particles with the aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm) is also monitored routinely in many countries (HEI, 2010). Available data show high levels of PM in Asian cities that often exceeded the respective national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). In particular, PM2.5 and PM10 normally exceed the 24 h WHO air quality guidelines by a factor of two or more (Hopke et al., 2008; Kim Oanh et al., 2006).
In Vietnam, in the past only TSP was measured and over a short sampling period (e.g. 1 h) but recently PM10 mass is continuously monitored in some urban areas by a network of automatic stations. Data on PM2.5 have been made available through research projects (Hien et al., 2001, Hien et al., 2002; Kim Oanh et al., 2006) and commonly show high levels in large cities. In Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam, higher PM levels are observed during the dry season which can be explained by high emission strength and limited atmospheric dispersion (Kim Oanh et al., 2006). Some data on PM2.5 mass and composition have been reported earlier (Hien et al., 2004; Kim Oanh et al., 2006) but mainly based on 24 h PM sampling. This paper presents the results of more time-resolved PM10 and PM2.5 monitoring, with 4 h averaging time (6 samples per day), conducted at a mixed site in Hanoi during winter. In addition to the water soluble ions and element compositions that were partly reported in early studies, this paper also provides the EC and OC data. The chemical composition of size-segregated atmospheric particles was used to quantitatively assess contributions from sources using the reconstructed mass approach and the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor model (Paatero and Tapper, 1994).

Study area
The monitoring was conducted during the period of December 2006–Feburary 2007 in the Hanoi capital city of Vietnam. Then the Hanoi Metropolitan Region (HMR) comprised of 7 inner districts and 5 suburban districts with a total area of around 921 km2 and the population of 3.3 million (GSO, 2006). Since 2008, the HMR has been expanded to cover a total area of 3348 km2 and the population of over 6.7 million (GSO, 2009). Hanoi is located in Red River delta, about 100 km from the East Vietnam Sea,
Daily PM levels in relation to meteorology
The daily (24 h) mass concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 during the sampling period were widely fluctuating (Fig. 1). The 24 h PM2.5 levels were averaged at 76 ± 32 μg m−3, ranged from 26 to 143 μg m−3, i.e. all measurements were above 24 h WHO guideline of 25 μg m−3. The 24 h PM10 levels during the period were 98 ± 35 μg m−3 (37–165 μg m−3) which exceeded the 24 h Vietnam NAAQS of 150 μg m−3 in 2 days and exceeding the WHO guideline (50 μg m−3) in 27 days (87% of the measurements). The
Conclusions
High PM levels were observed at a mixed site in Hanoi during the dry winter period with the fine fraction (PM2.5) contributed the majority (76%) to PM10. The daily PM2.5 levels were found to closely link to local wind speeds and directions (relative to local emission sources) and regional synoptic meteorology suggesting that both local sources and LRT contributed to the high PM levels at the site. Diurnal variations in PM2.5, EC, OC and EC/TC were similar and can be largely explained by the
