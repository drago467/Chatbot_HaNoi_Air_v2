## Key Findings về Transport Mechanisms

### 1. Southwesterly Winds + Biomass Burning → Cross-border Transport → PM2.5
- **Mechanism**: Driven by the southwesterly winds prevailing from the ICP to YP, the cross-border transport of pollutants was observed along the transport pathway with the lifting plateau topography
- **Quote**: "driven by the southwesterly winds prevailing from the ICP to YP, the cross-border transport of pollutants was observed along the transport pathway with the lifting plateau topography in YP"
- **Conditions**: Southwesterly winds, spring season (March)

### 2. Topography → Vertical Lifting → Regional Transport
- **Mechanism**: Large PM2.5 contributions of ICP BB emissions lift from the lower altitudes in SR (source region) to the higher altitudes in RR (receptor region) for the regional transport
- **Quote**: "the large PM2.5 contributions of ICP BB emissions lift from the lower altitudes in SR to the higher altitudes in RR for the regional transport of PM2.5"
- **Conditions**: Complex plateau topography

### 3. Wind Speed → Different Impacts on Source vs Receptor Regions
- **Mechanism**: Negative correlation between PM2.5 and wind speed in source region (local accumulation), positive correlation in receptor region (regional transport)
- **Quote**: "negative and positive correlation coefficients (R) between PM2.5 concentrations and wind speeds, respectively, were presented, indicating the different impacts of BB emissions on the two regions"
- **Conditions**: Source region vs receptor region proximity to BB sources

### 4. Transport Distance → Decreasing PM2.5 Contribution
- **Mechanism**: The contributions of regional transport of PM2.5 decrease with the increase in transport distance
- **Quote**: "the contributions of regional transport of PM2.5 decrease with the increase in transport distance, reflecting an important role of transport distance between the source–receptor areas in air pollution change"

### 5. Source Region vs Receptor Region Mechanisms
- **Source Region (SR)**: Mainly affected by ICP BB emissions with local accumulation in stagnant meteorological conditions
- **Receptor Region (RR)**: Dominated by regional transport of PM2.5 with strong winds and vertical mixing
- **Quote**: "The SR site is mainly affected by the ICP BB emissions with local accumulation in the stagnant meteorological conditions, whereas the RR site is dominated by the regional transport of PM2.5 with strong winds and vertical mixing"

## Spatial Scope
- Primary: Yunnan Plateau (YP), Southwest China
- Source region: Indo-China Peninsula (ICP), Southeast Asia
- Relevance to Vietnam: ICP includes Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia

## Temporal Scope
- Study period: 24-26 March 2017
- BB season: Spring (active fire activities)

## Methods Used
- WRF-Chem model
- FLEXPART-WRF model
- MODIS remote sensing products
- Ground-based observations

## Key Quantitative Data
- BB emissions can contribute 70-80% to total PM2.5 in source regions
- Southwesterly winds prevail in YP throughout the year
