## Key Findings về Transport Mechanisms

### 1. Northeast Monsoon → Long-range Transport → PM2.5
- **Mechanism**: When Northeast Monsoon is prevalent in dry winter season, there is high potential of regional transport on top of transboundary transport
- **Quote**: "when the Northeast Monsoon is prevalent in the dry winter season, there is a high potential of regional transport on the top of the transboundary transport of the pollution"
- **Conditions**: Winter, Northeast Monsoon

### 2. LRT-SIA Factor → 25% of PM2.5
- **Mechanism**: Long-range transported secondary inorganic aerosol (ammonium sulphate) with V, Ni, As indicates fossil fuel combustion transported from distance
- **Quote**: "Factor 5 was an LRT-SIA factor contributing 25% of RM. The factor consists of ammonium (45%), sulphate (56%) and EC (30%)... Ammonium sulphate refers to longer distance transported pollution where SO2 has oxidized and reacted with ammonia"
- **Conditions**: Higher contribution during winter months when Northeast Monsoon prevalent

### 3. Back-trajectory Analysis → Source Attribution
- **Mechanism**: Backwards trajectories showed air masses arriving from the north-east carrying pollutants from Northern Vietnam and South China
- **Quote**: "Backwards trajectories showed air masses arriving from the north-east carrying pollutants from Northern Vietnam and South China"
- **Method**: HYSPLIT 72h backward trajectory

### 4. Stagnant Conditions → PM2.5 Accumulation
- **Mechanism**: Low nocturnal boundary layer height and low wind speed indicate stagnant atmospheric conditions supporting accumulation of local pollutants
- **Quote**: "the nocturnal boundary layer height was low (42 m), and wind speed was low (1.4 m/s, daily average) which indicates stagnant atmospheric conditions and supports the accumulation of local pollutants"
- **Conditions**: Low BLH (<50 m), low wind speed (<1 m/s)

### 5. Regional Transport from Industrial Sources
- **Mechanism**: Coal-fired power plants in Hai Phong and Quang Ninh Provinces are large stationary sources; Hanoi is located downwind of provinces with intensive industrial activities
- **Quote**: "Hanoi is located downwind of several provinces in Northern Vietnam including those having intensive industrial activities, such as Thai Nguyen, Quang Ninh, Bac Ninh, and Hung Yen"

## Source Apportionment (PMF)
- Traffic: 12%
- Local SIA: 18%
- Biomass burning: 19%
- Industry: 9%
- **Long-range transported SIA: 25%**
- Dust: 17%

## Spatial Scope
- Primary: Hanoi (traffic site and UGA site)
- Source regions: Northern Vietnam, South China

## Temporal Scope
- Study period: August 2019 – July 2020
- Focus: Seasonal variation, winter high pollution episodes

## Key Quantitative Data
- Annual PM2.5: 49 μg/m³ (traffic), 46 μg/m³ (UGA)
- Highest monthly: December (93 μg/m³ traffic, 76 μg/m³ UGA)
- LRT contribution: 25% of resolved mass
