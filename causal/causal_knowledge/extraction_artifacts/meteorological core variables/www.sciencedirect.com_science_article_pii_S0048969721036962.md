Abstract
Surface radiation is crucial to atmospheric boundary layer development and air pollution formation. Several studies have revealed that surface radiation plays a vital role in developing the daytime convective boundary layer that controls the explosive growth of PM2.5 concentration; however, less attention has been paid to the effects of changing nighttime surface radiation on the near-surface temperature inversion layer and PM2.5 accumulation. In this study, we used long-term observations of meteorological and environmental data and atmospheric boundary layer measurements during a severe PM2.5 pollution event to investigate the effect of changes in nocturnal surface radiation on the increase in PM2.5 concentrations. The results showed that surface radiation cooling was enhanced (weakened) by decreased (increased) cloud cover fraction by changing longwave radiation at night; this strengthened (weakened) near-surface temperature inversion intensity and promoted (prevented) the accumulated increase in PM2.5. This observational study using 5-year data further confirmed the cloud radiative effect on the nighttime accumulation of PM2.5 with a significant negative correlation between nighttime averages of surface PM2.5 concentrations and cloud cover fractions. This reveals an important mechanism for the impact of surface radiation cooling modulated by cloud cover change on the nighttime accumulated increase in PM2.5. This finding extends our understanding of air pollutant accumulation at night with potential implications for atmospheric environment change.

Introduction
Air pollution with high concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5; an aerodynamic diameter equal to or smaller than 2.5 μm) frequently occurs during interactions between air pollutants and atmospheric processes (An et al., 2019; Ding and Liu, 2014; Dui, 2011; Fu et al., 2014; Fu and Chen, 2017). Elevated PM2.5 levels increase the absorption of solar radiation in the upper aerosol layers and decrease the solar radiation reaching the surface. This can consequently depress heat turbulence and vertical mixing in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and reduce the mixing layer height (Zhang et al., 2011), leading to a positive feedback where aerosol radiation enhances ambient PM2.5 levels and deteriorates air quality (Ding et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2018). The two-way feedback between unfavorable PBL meteorology and aerosols accounts for 73%–93% of PM2.5 pollution in various regions of China (Zhong et al., 2017) and is regarded as the main process for extreme PM2.5 pollution in China (Li et al., 2017b; Liu et al., 2019a; Zhong et al., 2019). However, such two-way aerosol radiative feedback may only account for daytime aerosol pollution by influencing solar radiation and strengthening stable meteorological conditions for PM2.5 accumulation. However, this feedback cannot explain the cumulative PM2.5 pollution during nighttime, when the effect of nocturnal surface radiation on a stable boundary layer occurs.
The nighttime increase in PM2.5 concentration is primarily caused by internal factors, such as enhanced primate emissions and secondary transformation, as well as external factors, including unfavorable meteorological conditions (Wallace and Kanaroglou, 2009; Wang et al., 2014a; Wang et al., 2014b). Strong primary emissions have been identified as the primary contributors to the increase in nocturnal PM2.5 levels in the North China Plain (Wei et al., 2020). Heavy trucks always operate on-road at night, resulting in apparent increases in traffic emissions (Cheng et al., 2020). Additionally, the secondary transformation of primary gaseous pollutants to secondary aerosols is favored under nighttime higher relative humidity (RH) conditions, resulting in a rapid increase in the mass of PM2.5 (Li et al., 2017a; Wang et al., 2014b). Stagnant meteorological conditions are critical in driving the nocturnal accumulation of PM2.5 mass (Zhang et al., 2014). After sunset, an air temperature inversion layer forms owing to surface radiation cooling, limiting the vertical diffusion of PM2.5 and consequently promoting PM2.5 accumulation (Gramsch et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017b; Zang et al., 2017). However, few studies have been conducted on the changes in nighttime surface radiation cooling and its effects on near-surface temperature inversion layer variations and surface PM2.5 accumulation. Nocturnal, surface radiation cooling is determined by longwave radiation which is negatively related to cloud cover. Daytime clouds can scatter and reflect solar radiation, resulting in a net cooling effect on the surface, which depresses convective PBL development and promotes PM2.5 accumulation (Liu et al., 2019a; Sarangi et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2019). However, nighttime clouds have a net warming effect on the surface owing to trap longwave radiation emitted by the surface and radiate it back downward (Zhang et al., 2016), which has a completely different impact on PBL stratification and PM2.5. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how changes in surface longwave radiation cooling affect nocturnal PM2.5 pollution and how clouds changes modulate this effect in the nighttime.
The Sichuan Basin (SCB), located in Southwest China, suffers from severe air pollution owing to high anthropogenic emissions and deep basin topography (Luo et al., 2014; Tao et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018) (Fig. 1). As one of the cloudiest areas in China, the SCB has a climatologically high cloud cover fraction (CCF) of more than 80% and low surface solar radiation of less than 160 W m−2 (Jia et al., 2013; Qian et al., 2007). Chengdu, a metropolis located in the western SCB (Fig. 1), has the highest PM2.5 pollution levels in the SCB, owing to a stable PBL and weak near-surface winds (Chang et al., 2009; Chen and Xie, 2014; Ning et al., 2018). However, less attention is paid on the effect of cloud radiation on PM2.5 pollution in Chengdu, SCB, particularly at night, which deserves further investigation.
In this study, we performed long-term observations of nighttime PM2.5 mass, surface radiation, and cloud fraction, in conjunction with a PM2.5 pollution case using PBL measurements, to obtain a better understanding of how changes in the nighttime surface radiation cooling impact PM2.5 accumulation. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the observational data and analysis methods. Section 3 presents the analysis of the mechanism of nocturnal PM2.5 accumulation from the perspectives of vertical temperature structures and surface radiation budget modulated by changes in cloud cover. Finally, the conclusions are provided in Section 4.

Field measurements
In this study, field measurement was performed at the Wenjiang station (30.42° N, 103.50° E; altitude: 544 m) in Chengdu, a city with a population of 14.0 million and an area of 12,390 km2, located in the west of the SCB. The station is surrounded by a region of flat terrain with agricultural land use that is representative of land use in the SCB and meets the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) requirements (Jiang et al., 2012; Oke, 2004).
Relationship between surface PM2.5 concentration and surface radiation cooling
To investigate the effect of surface radiation budget on surface PM2.5 mass at night, we calculated the nighttime (20:00 to 8:00 of the next morning) average of the surface total net radiation (TNR) in different PM2.5 mass ranges at Chengdu during the winter of 2017. The surface TNR, which characterizes the surface radiation budget, is the difference between the total upward and downward radiation (Liang, 2005). Nocturnal TNR was calculated by subtracting upward longwave radiation (ULR) from
Summary
This study showed that nighttime surface radiation cooling was critical for the accumulated increase in PM2.5. The analysis of meteorological and environmental observations in the winter of 2017 revealed that elevated PM2.5 concentrations occurred primarily under the condition of strong surface radiation cooling at night. We used PBL measurements taken during a severe PM2.5 pollution event to further examine the nighttime surface radiation cooling effect on PM2.5. We found that surface

In particular, FWP is surrounded by mountain ranges and has static winds, making it susceptible to inversions in winter (Cao and Cui, 2021; Feng et al., 2016; Li et al., 2022a), while SCB is occluded by topography and prone to stagnant air weather. All these factors make it difficult for pollutants to diffuse (Hu et al., 2021; Liao et al., 2018; Kong et al., 2020). In conclusion, for the overall situation during 2014–2022, FWP and BTH had the most serious PM2.5 pollution, followed by NEP and YRD, and SCB and PRD had the least serious PM2.5 pollution.

Role of garbage classification in air pollution improvement of a municipal solid waste disposal base
2023, Journal of Cleaner Production
Citation Excerpt :

In fall and winter, high VOC concentrations occurred more frequently, particularly during the period when garbage classification was not implemented. This seasonal characteristic may be due to the frequent occurrence of temperature inversion in fall and winter, which leads to the gradual accumulation of pollutants in ambient air (Han et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2021). The diurnal variation in the concentration of VOCs at the YQ site is shown in Fig. 5.

Vertical changes of PM2.5 driven by meteorology in the atmospheric boundary layer during a heavy air pollution event in central China
2023, Science of the Total Environment
Citation Excerpt :

A low ABLH facilitates pollutant accumulation near the ground, and the peak values of air pollutants, distributed at higher layers during air pollution, are induced by the regional transport of air pollutants (Sekuła et al., 2021; Song et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020). Moreover, air temperature inversion in the ABL could inhibit the vertical mixing of PM2.5 (Bai et al., 2022a; Hu et al., 2021a; Song et al., 2021). The vertical changes in wind speed and wind direction alter the vertical transport of air pollutants for air pollution (Han et al., 2018; Sekuła et al., 2021).

Citation Excerpt :

Stagnant meteorological conditions in winter are a major contributor to nighttime PM2.5 accumulation (Hu et al., 2021). Due to the surface radiation cooling after sunset, an air temperature inversion layer forms, limiting vertical PM2.5 diffusion and promoting PM2.5 accumulation (Hu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2017c). For example, because of the stagnant meteorological conditions during the first local epidemic event, Chengdu experienced an extremely polluted period lasting 6 days (from the 23rd to the December 28, 2020).
