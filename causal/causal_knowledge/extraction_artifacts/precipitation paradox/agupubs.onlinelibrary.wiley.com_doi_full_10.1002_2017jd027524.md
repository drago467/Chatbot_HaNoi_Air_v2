## Abstract

Aerosol-meteorology interactions can change surface aerosol concentrations via different mechanisms such as altering radiation budget or cloud microphysics. However, few studies investigated the impacts of different mechanisms on temporal and spatial distribution of PM <sub>2\.5</sub> concentrations over China. Here we used the fully coupled Weather Research and Forecasting model with online chemistry (WRF-Chem) to quantify the enhancement of PM <sub>2\.5</sub> concentrations by aerosol-meteorology feedback in China in 2014 for different seasons and separate the relative impacts of aerosol radiation interactions (ARIs) and aerosol-cloud interactions (ACIs). We found that ARIs and ACIs could increase population-weighted annual mean PM <sub>2\.5</sub> concentration over China by 4.0 μg/m <sup>3</sup> and 1.6 μg/m <sup>3</sup> , respectively. We found that ARIs play a dominant role in aerosol-meteorology interactions in winter, while the enhancement of PM <sub>2\.5</sub> concentration by ARIs and ACIs is comparable in other three seasons. ARIs reduced the wintertime monthly mean wind speed and planetary boundary layer (PBL) height by up to 0.1 m/s and 160 m, respectively, but increased the relative humidity by up to 4%, leading to accumulation of pollutants within PBL. Also, ARIs reduced dry deposition velocity of aerosols by up to 20%, resulting in an increase in PM <sub>2\.5</sub> lifetime and concentrations. ARIs can increase wintertime monthly mean surface PM <sub>2\.5</sub> concentration by a maximum of 30 μg/m <sup>3</sup> in Sichuan Basin. ACIs can also increase PM <sub>2\.5</sub> concentration with more significant impacts in wet seasons via reduced wet scavenging and enhanced in-cloud chemistry. Dominant processes in PM <sub>2\.5</sub> enhancement are also clarified in different seasons. Results show that physical process is more important than chemical processes in winter in ARIs, while chemical process of secondary inorganic aerosols production may be crucial in wet seasons via ACIs.

## Key Points

* Temporal and spatial distributions of aerosol-meteorology interactions were analyzed
* PM <sub>2\.5</sub> concentration was enhanced due to lower PBL height, weaker surface wind, wetter air, and slower dry deposition via ARIs
* Enhancement of PM <sub>2\.5</sub> due to ARIs is dominant in winter, while aerosol indirect effect is crucial in wetter seasons

## 1 Introduction

Interactions between aerosols and meteorology have been a source of concern for many scientists in recent decades. Aerosols are crucial in determining global radiative forcing; thus, they interfere in thermodynamic processes within the climate system, which can be called as aerosol direct effect or aerosol-radiation interactions (ARIs). They also serve as cloud condensation nuclei and are involved in many aspects of highly complex cloud microphysical processes, which is also called aerosol indirect effect or aerosol-cloud interactions (ACIs) (Charlson & Schwartz, [1992]() ; Z. Li et al., [2017]() ; Liao et al, [2015]() ; Twomey, [1991]() ).
