Abstract
Transportation projects must undergo a transportation conformity hot-spot analysis if they are designated as projects of local air quality concern (POAQC). We examined particulate matter 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter or smaller (PM2.5) concentrations measured in 2017 from 48 near-road monitoring sites across the U.S. Annual average PM2.5 increments, the difference between near-road and background PM2.5, were between 0.1 ± 0.2 µg/m3 and 2.0 ± 0.2 µg/m3 for sites without noted confounding factor(s). The highest PM2.5 increment from monitors 10 or more meters from the roadway was 1.4 ± 0.2 µg/m3. Using modeled national average exhaust emissions, and associated near-road contribution to PM2.5, the upper bound of 2.0 ± 0.2 µg/m3 is projected to decrease 30% from 2017 to 2040, for the types of highways assessed here, assuming a roadway with 8% heavy-duty vehicles and constant traffic volumes. These results can help inform transportation conformity POAQC designations.

1. Introduction
Motor vehicle emissions contribute to particulate matter in the United States through the direct emission of particulate matter 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter or smaller (PM2.5) and the emission of precursor gases that form PM2.5 through gas-to-particle conversion (McCarthy et al., 2006, Abu-Allaban et al., 2007, Brown et al., 2012, Jimenez et al., 2009, May et al., 2014, Saha et al., 2018a, Stroud et al., 2014, Massoli et al., 2012, Kittelson et al., 2006). For roadways with significant traffic, a concern is the potential for elevated localized PM2.5 levels, i.e., hot spots (Yanosky et al., 2018, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2015a). A number of factors impact the traffic contribution to PM2.5, including the traffic mix and volume, the age of vehicles, vehicle speed, meteorological conditions, local topography, and the built environment, including roadway geometry and the presence of barriers or sound walls (Zhu et al., 2002, Baldauf et al., 2008, Baldauf et al., 2016, Yanosky et al., 2018).
Diesel emissions from heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) are an important component of total roadway PM2.5 emissions (Gertler, 2005, California Air Resources Board, 2015). The vehicle fleet of the U.S. is dominated by gasoline conventional cars, light trucks, commercial trucks (including HDDVs), with a smaller fraction (~1.6%) of hybrid and electric vehicles that is forecast to increase in the coming decades (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2020). In addition to exhaust emissions, traffic-related PM2.5 emissions also include brake wear, tire wear, and re-suspended road dust (Gertler et al., 2000, Clayton et al., 2003, Dabek-Zlotorzynska et al., 2019). Beginning in 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandated the deployment of air quality monitors alongside selected major roadways in the United States; these have been used to examine the impact of traffic-related pollution (Watkins, 2016, Seagram et al., 2019, DeWinter et al., 2018). Measurements at the near-road sites focus on PM2.5, carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and typically do not include PM10 measurements.
Given that approximately 20% of the U.S. population lives near major roadways, studies have examined the associations between exposure to traffic-related pollutants (TRAPs) and health outcomes (Rowangould, 2013, Urman et al., 2014, Brandt et al., 2014, Starling et al., 2020, Hegseth et al., 2019). Studies have found negative health impacts, such as reduced lung function, low birth weights, and increased asthma and risk of heart failure, for individuals living within 300 m of major roadways (Ghosh et al., 2016, Urman et al., 2014, Brandt et al., 2014, Health Effects Institute, 2010). Even modest exposure to TRAPs can lead to respiratory symptoms (Hegseth et al., 2019).
Quantifying the contribution of major roadways to near-road PM2.5 is an ongoing field of study. A study of three urban sites in Canada found that traffic-related emissions contributed between 15 and 35% of PM2.5, primarily through exhaust emissions (diesel and gasoline), re-suspended road dust and break wear (Dabek-Zlotorzynska et al., 2019). Prior studies examined incremental PM2.5 impacts from major roads, using U.S. near-road monitor data from 2015 and 2016 (Seagram et al., 2019, DeWinter et al., 2018, Brown et al., 2019, Rattigan et al., 2020). A study of two-year average incremental PM2.5 from 2017 to 2018 found an average increment value of 0.5 μg/m3 (0.17 – 0.84 μg/m3, 95% confidence interval) based on 72 U.S. near-road monitors and nearby sites, with higher incremental impacts seen for rural sites (Lal et al., 2020). This corresponded to an average traffic contribution of 5% of total PM2.5 at near road sites. The study herein provides novel results by examining the annual average PM2.5 increments in 2017 while accounting for confounding factors, and by presenting increments calculated using two different methods.
Clean Air Act (CAA) section 176(c) (42 U.S.C. 7506(c)) mandates that transportation projects that are federally funded must not cause or worsen air quality violations or delay attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and must conform to the purpose of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for air quality (i.e., “transportation conformity”). CAA transportation conformity requirements are promulgated by the EPA to ensure that federally funded transportation projects do not impede the SIP. In 2006, EPA issued a final rule (40 CFR 93.123(b)(1)) entitled “PM2.5 and PM10 Hot-Spot Analysis in Project-Level Transportation Determinations for the New PM2.5 and Existing PM10 National Ambient Air Quality Standards” (PM hot-spot rule), and in 2015 EPA issued updated guidance for quantitative PM hot-spot analyses (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2015a). Accordingly, transportation projects are required to undergo quantitative PM hot-spot analysis if they are identified, through interagency consultation among federal, state, and local air quality and transportation agencies, as a project of local air quality concern (POAQC).
The transportation conformity regulation (40 CFR 93.123(b)) defines conditions to determine whether a project is a POAQC; these conditions include significant levels of diesel vehicle traffic or identification in a PM SIP as a POAQC. The preamble to the 2006 final rule gives this example: “A project on a new highway or expressway… with annual average daily traffic (AADT) greater than 125,000 where 8% or more of such AADT is diesel truck traffic.” In practice, the final decision of whether a project is a POAQC is discussed and decided through interagency consultation. If a project is determined to be POAQC, the subsequent PM2.5 hot-spot analysis must follow a detailed procedure accounting for base-year and future-year traffic activity related to the proposed project, and modeling associated emissions and air quality. Contributions of PM2.5 that are modeled to result from the project are summed with the estimated background concentration and compared to the NAAQS. Required transportation conformity analyses can vary depending on the area—for example, modeling road dust is not required for every analysis. Given the complexity of quantitative PM2.5 hot-spot analyses, information that clarifies which projects are unlikely to be a POAQC is valuable. The work presented here improves understanding of incremental PM2.5 impacts of major U.S. roadways and can directly inform POAQC determinations.
The objectives of this near-road particulate matter study were to: (1) assess the annual average increment of PM2.5 representing the impact of roadway emissions on PM2.5 at near-road monitoring sites in 2017, (2) quantify the relationship between the increments and site-specific factors such as traffic volumes and the monitor’s distance to the roadway, (3) use modeled exhaust emissions to forecast changes in traffic-related PM2.5 between 2017 and 2040, and (4) draw insights relevant to the conformity requirements for transportation project PM2.5 hot-spot analysis, including implications for which transportation projects can be reasonably excluded from consideration as a POAQC. This study provides novel results including an examination of which near-road sites had high incremental PM2.5, what factors are associated with high incremental PM2.5, and how traffic-related PM2.5 is forecast to change in the coming decades as the vehicle fleet changes and exhaust emissions decrease.
2. Methods
This study examined the contribution of roadway emissions to annual average PM2.5 concentrations at U.S. near-road monitors in 2017. To complete PM2.5 increment analyses, we refined the data to remove various confounding factors that might skew understanding of roadway impacts. First, we examined PM2.5 measurements from 48 near-road sites that had at least one ambient site within 40 km where PM2.5 measurements met EPA data completeness thresholds during 2017. Total near-road PM2.5 concentrations from these sites were compared to the NAAQS to establish a national-scale understanding of near-road PM2.5. Next, we narrowed our sample to 40 near-road sites where the near-road and the ambient site measured PM2.5 using identical monitoring instruments, and we estimated PM2.5 increments for those sites. Each of the 40 near-road sites was then evaluated for potential confounding factors, including characteristics of the near-road environment (such as site elevation or the presence of nearby barriers, commonality of land use between near-road and background monitors, and potential sea breeze effects) that could skew findings. Removing sites with a noted confounding factor resulted in a sample of 20 near-road monitoring sites. The locations of the near-road sites used at each stage of analysis are shown in Fig. 1. In summary, we narrowed our data sample to remove confounding factors and improve increment evaluation in the following progression:
1.
48 sites: all of the near-road sites with an ambient monitor available for background
2.
40 sites: near-road sites paired with ambient sites using identical monitoring instruments
3.
20 sites: our “focused case” sample after addressing confounding factors

Fig. 1. Locations of the 48 near-road PM2.5 monitoring sites operating in 2017. Eight sites had no matching instrument at the near-road and nearby ambient sites, incremental PM2.5 is calculated for the remaining 40 sites. Of those 40 sites, 20 sites had a noted confounding factor, the focused case is the remaining 20 sites.

The statistical relationships between the annual average PM2.5 increment and traffic volumes, distance from roadway, and meteorological variables were assessed for the 20 site cases using pairwise correlation of determination (R2), regression models, and a general additive model (GAM). Finally, we used the near-road increments calculated with 2017 data and emissions forecasts to estimate the traffic impact on PM2.5 from 2018 to 2040. The forecast analysis employed estimates of the fraction of traffic-related PM2.5 emissions originating from exhaust, as well as estimated changes in exhaust emissions, predicted by the EPA Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES) and the Emission FACtors (EMFAC) models. We then evaluated the implications of these results for the POAQC designation of proposed highway projects.
2.1. Data sources
This section details the sources of data used in this study, completeness thresholds, initial data processing steps, and methods used to calculate variables.
2.1.1. Air quality data and near-road site characteristics
A list of near-road monitoring sites and site information is available from the EPA at https://www3.epa.gov/ttnamti1/nearroad.html. Sites in this study are identified by their EPA Air Quality System (AQS) site ID codes. Some cities have multiple near-road sites (e.g., Denver-0027 and Denver-0028), and some sites have collocated measurements of PM2.5, identified by their parameter occurrence code (POC) (e.g., Milwaukee-0056-1 and Milwaukee-0056-3). EPA also provides the geographic coordinates of the monitor and the distance of the near-road monitor from the road, defined as the distance to the edge of the roadway. EPA metadata include AADT and fleet-equivalent AADT (FE-AADT) information for the target road from the year of site installation. EPA developed the FE-AADT calculation to represent an emissions-weighted traffic volume, taking into account both AADT and fleet mix (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2012). FE-AADT is calculated as:
AADT
-
𝐻
𝐷
𝑐
+
𝐻
𝐷
𝑚
×
𝐻
𝐷
𝑐
where HDc is the volume of heavy-duty vehicles on the target roadway, and HDm is a scaling factor that represents the ratio of heavy-duty to light-duty emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx). The number of HDDVs was estimated from FE-AADT and AADT, using the EPA’s recommended national default scaling value of HDm = 10. Because the provided FE-AADT is based on NOx emissions, we use it as a proxy for HDDV scaled traffic, and also examine the relationship between number of HDDVs and incremental PM2.5 directly.
Daily and hourly PM2.5 measurements from all ambient monitors within 40 km of a near-road site were acquired from EPA’s AQS. The network of ambient monitors was designed to monitor regional compliance with federal and state health standards, so ambient monitors are not typically sited in areas known to be near major emission sources. AQS measurements have been quality-controlled by the submitting agency. Data with specific qualifier flags to indicate quality assurance errors or exceptional events were excluded from this analysis. Only near-road and ambient measurement sets with over 75% completeness in at least 3 out of 4 quarters (Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec) were used in this study. Measurements from 48 near-road sites, and their nearby ambient monitors were used in the study.
Near-road sites with sufficient data completeness are presented in Supplementary Table S1, along with site characteristics. Land use indicators of population density, land surface imperviousness, and urban percentage show the near-road sites span a range of environments. Near-road monitors are stationed within 50 m of major roadways; the monitor’s distance to road and the roadway’s AADT and FE-AADT values are presented in Table 1 for the 20-site case.
