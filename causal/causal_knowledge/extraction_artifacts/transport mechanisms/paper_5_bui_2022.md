## Key Findings về Transport Mechanisms

### 1. North/Northeast Winds → Long-range Transport → PM2.5 in Winter
- **Mechanism**: With the predominance of north and northeast winds during the winter period, the long-range transport of air pollutants from highly industrialized areas and intensive fire regions in southern China and Southeast Asia
- **Quote**: "with the predominance of north and northeast winds during the winter period, the long-range transport of air pollutants which emitted from the highly industrialized areas and the intensive fire regions in the southern part of China and Southeast Asia region were likely other important sources for the highly elevated concentrations of PM2.5"
- **Conditions**: Winter period, north/northeast winds

### 2. Seasonal Meteorology → PM2.5 Accumulation
- **Mechanism**: Unfavorable meteorological conditions (lower wind speed and lower boundary layer height) in the winter period were identified as key factors contributing to high PM2.5 pollution
- **Quote**: "The unfavorable meteorological conditions (lower wind speed and lower boundary layer height) in the winter period were identified as one of the key factors contributing to the high PM2.5 pollution in this period"
- **Conditions**: Winter period, low wind speed, low boundary layer height

### 3. Back-trajectory Analysis → Source Identification
- **Method**: Three-day air mass backward trajectories using HYSPLIT model to identify impact of fire source regions in Asia
- **Quote**: "the analysis of three-day air mass backward trajectories arrived at the sampling site in Hanoi was carried out to identify and assess the likely impact of fire source regions in the Asia region"
- **Starting height**: 1500 m above-ground level

### 4. Stationary Sources → Regional Transport → Winter PM2.5
- **Mechanism**: Emissions from stationary sources (coal burning for cement, steel, and coal-fired power plants in surrounding provinces of Hanoi) were significant sources through atmospheric transport
- **Quote**: "emissions from stationary sources (i.e., coal burning for cement, steel, and coal-fired power plants in the surrounding provinces of Hanoi) were likely the significant sources of local air pollution through atmospheric transport process during the winter period"

## Spatial Scope
- Primary: Hanoi, Vietnam (urban site at Hanoi University of Civil Engineering)
- Source regions: Southern China, Southeast Asia, surrounding provinces of Hanoi

## Temporal Scope
- Summer: July 2020
- Winter: January 2021

## Key Quantitative Data
- Winter PM2.5: 122.90 μg/m³ (average)
- Summer PM2.5: 40.20 μg/m³ (average)
- Winter PM2.5 about 3 times higher than summer
- Wind speed in summer 1.31 times higher than winter
- Boundary layer height in summer 1.26 times higher than winter
