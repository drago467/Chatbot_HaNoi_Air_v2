## Key Findings

### Seasonal Pattern of Transboundary PM2.5

The study documents clear seasonal patterns of transboundary biomass burning PM2.5 (TB PM2.5) during the dry season (January-May):

**January**: TB PM2.5 influx begins from southern directions, relatively light levels.

**February**: Increase in TB PM2.5 across all provinces, shifting northward.

**March**: Peak month with highest TB PM2.5 proportions. Average TB PM2.5 across 9 provinces reached 32.91 µg/m³ (46% of total PM2.5).

**April**: Elevated levels persist, similar to March patterns.

**May**: Decline in TB PM2.5 as dry season ends.

### Quantitative Contributions

The paper provides detailed quantitative data on transboundary contributions:

**Chiang Rai province**: Highest average TB PM2.5 proportion reaching up to **45%** of total PM2.5. In March, TB PM2.5 averaged **86.53 µg/m³** (68% of total).

**On unhealthy air quality days**: TB PM2.5 contributed at least **50%** to total PM2.5 at all monitoring stations.

**5-month average across 9 provinces**: TB PM2.5 = 13.22 µg/m³ (30% of total PM2.5).

### Key Mechanisms

1. **Transboundary transport**: Biomass burning emissions from Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia transported to Northern Thailand by prevailing winds.

2. **Topography effects**: Complex mountainous formations influence pollutant dispersion and accumulation.

3. **Temperature inversions**: Local meteorological conditions exacerbate PM2.5 concentrations.

4. **El Niño effects**: 2019 haze event was particularly severe due to ENSO conditions.

### Health Impact Categories

The study classified TB PM2.5 impacts using US EPA health categories:

- **Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (>35.4 µg/m³)**: All stations exceeded for minimum 31 days with ≥25% TB PM2.5.

- **Unhealthy (>55.4 µg/m³)**: All stations experienced continuous TB PM2.5 influence exceeding 50% for at least 1 day.

- **Very Unhealthy (>150.4 µg/m³)**: Only Chiang Rai (57t) and Nan (67t) stations detected TB PM2.5 at these extreme levels.

### Regional Context for SEA

The paper notes that Southeast Asia frequently experiences haze episodes caused by:
- Open burning of crop residues
- Slash-and-burn agriculture
- Forest and peatland fires

Major source countries include Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand.

## Relevant Quotes for Extraction

1. "TB PM2.5 significantly influences local PM2.5 levels, often surpassing contributions from local sources."

2. "On days when PM2.5 levels were classified as 'Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups' or 'Unhealthy', TB PM2.5 contributed at least 50% to the total PM2.5 at all stations."

3. "The influx of TB PM2.5 began in January from southern directions, intensifying and shifting northward, peaking in March with the highest TB PM2.5 proportions."

4. "Border provinces consistently exhibited higher TB PM2.5 concentrations, with Chiang Rai province showing the highest average proportion, reaching up to 45%."
