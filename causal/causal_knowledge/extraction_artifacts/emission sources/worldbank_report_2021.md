## Key Findings on PM2.5 Sources in Hanoi

### Primary PM2.5 Sources (Emission Inventory 2015)
1. **Industrial activities**: 29%
2. **Open burning of rice straw (crop residue burning)**: 26%
3. **Road dust**: 23%
4. **Transport (mainly road transport)**: 15%
5. **Others**: residential/commercial combustion, craft villages, waste

### Source Apportionment (GAINS Model 2015-2020)
- **Total Secondary Particulate Matter (SPM)**: 57%
- **Biomass burning**: 15%
- **Transport**: 14%
- **Industry**: 6%
- **Seasalt, dust**: 5%
- **Transboundary**: 3%

### Key Findings on Source Origins
> "Only about one third of PM2.5 in the ambient air originates from local emission sources while the rest is transported from the Greater Hanoi areas, Red River Delta Region, other provinces in Vietnam, as well as other countries, international shipping and natural sources"

### PM2.5 Source Categories from Chart (Page 12)
Sources by origin:
- Natural Sources
- Other Countries
- Other North and South Vietnam
- Other Hanoi Capital region
- Bac Ninh, Hung Yen
- This Province (Hanoi)

Source types include:
- Municipal waste
- Agriculture
- Transport
- Residential
- Industry
- Power plant
- Cement
- Soil dust, seasalt

### Secondary PM2.5
> "About half of the Particulate Matter mass composed of secondary particulate matter (SPM)"

### Coal-fired Power Plants
- Most coal-fired power plants are located East of Hanoi
- Contribute to regional PM2.5 through long-range transport
- Significant source of SO2 and NOx (precursors for secondary PM2.5)

### Health Impact
- 32% or 5,800 deaths in Hanoi attributed to ambient PM2.5
- ~8 million people exposed to PM2.5 > 45 μg/m³
