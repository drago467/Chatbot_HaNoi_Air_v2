## Key Findings

### PM2.5 Concentrations
- Annual average: 40.2 ± 26.3 μg/m³ (Sept 2019 - Dec 2020)
- Range: 8.3 to 148 μg/m³
- 2x higher than Vietnam national limit (25 μg/m³ annual)

### Source Apportionment (PMF model - 9 sources)
1. **HFO combustion**: 25.3% - Tracers: V, Ni, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, SO₄²⁻
2. **Biomass burning**: 20.0% - Tracers: levoglucosan, K⁺, OC, PAHs, HuLiS
3. **Mineral dust**: 14.7% - Tracers: Ca²⁺, Al, Mg²⁺, Fe (resuspension)
4. **Long-range transport**: 10.6% - Tracers: NO₃⁻, NH₄⁺, SO₄²⁻ (SIA)
5. **Biogenic**: 9.4% - Tracers: 3-MBTCA, polyols
6. **Primary traffic**: 7.6% - Tracers: Cu, EC, Sb, Sn, Pb, phthalic acid
7. **Coal burning**: 6.4% - Tracers: As, Sb, Cd, Pb, EC, PAH1, PAH2
8. **Industrial**: Tracers: Zn, Pb, Cd, Mn, Cl⁻ (metal/smelting)
9. **Long-range Cl-rich industrial**: Tracers: Cl⁻, Na⁺, MSA

### Important Quotes for Extraction

**Biomass Burning**:
> "High loadings of OC, levoglucosan, K⁺, PAH5, PAH3 and PAH4, phthalic acid and HuLiS identify the biomass burning factor"
> "The average contribution of the biomass-burning factor is around 20%, but it presents a maximum contribution of up to 51% during winter"
> "During the first rice harvest season, open field burning for rice straw is observed around June, while the second burning period is observed in October"

**Traffic**:
> "The traffic factor is identified by its high Cu loading and the contribution of EC, phthalic acid, Sb, Sn, Pb and PAH5"
> "Cu, Sb, and Sn are commonly associated with non-exhaust vehicle emissions, including brake and tire wear"
> "The temporal contribution of the primary road traffic factor is quite constant"
> "motorcycles accounting for 86% of the total vehicle fleet in the country and with >5 million vehicles registered in Hanoi"

**Coal Burning**:
> "Several coal-fired power plants are located within 200 km of Hanoi, which are large emitters of gases and particles into the atmosphere"
> "The coal-burning profile is characterized by a high contribution of As, Sb, Cd, Pb, EC, PAH1 and PAH2"
> "Vietnam experienced one of the fastest growth in coal consumption over 2011–2021, at an average rate of 11% per year"

**Industry**:
> "The industrial factor is identified by the high contribution of Zn, Pb, Cd, Mn, Cl⁻ and minor loadings of other metals"
> "Metals such as Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn are known as tracers of the iron industry"

**Dust/Construction**:
> "The mineral dust factor shows a relatively high content of elements such as Ca²⁺, Al, Mg²⁺ and Fe, commonly originating from the resuspension of soils and road dust"
> "mixing between terrigenous aerosols and mineral particles linked to human activities (e.g., dust from constructions, soil resuspension from road transport)"

### Seasonal Patterns
- Winter: Higher PM2.5, biomass burning peaks (up to 51%)
- Summer: Lower PM2.5, dust factor higher
- Rice harvest seasons: June and October - biomass burning
- Traffic: Constant throughout year, lower during COVID-19 lockdown

### Location
- Urban site in Hanoi, Vietnam (21.0489°N, 105.8011°E)
- Rooftop sampling at 30m above ground level
