## Key Findings về Transport Mechanisms

### 1. Cold Surge Onset → Long-range Transport → PM2.5 Increase
- **Mechanism**: During cold surge onsets, long-range transport from China causes an average increase of ~30% in PM2.5 concentrations
- **Quote**: "long-range transport from China during the onset of cold surges caused an average increase of around 30% of the PM2.5 level in Hanoi"
- **Conditions**: Winter period (October to March), Northeast monsoon

### 2. Cold Surge Persistence → Local Pollution Stagnation → PM2.5 Increase
- **Mechanism**: The stagnation of local pollution during the cold surges persistence causes an average increase of ~40% in level of PM2.5
- **Quote**: "The stagnation of local pollution during the cold surges persistence causes an average increase of ∼40% in level of PM2.5"
- **Conditions**: During cold surge persistence phase

### 3. Northeast Monsoon → Air Mass Pathways → Pollution Transport
- **Mechanism**: Northeast monsoon cycles create periodic changes in air mass pathways and meteorological conditions, bringing pollution from eastern China and the industrial region surrounding Hanoi (Red River Delta)
- **Quote**: "During regular winters, northeastern air masses predominated, which can bring pollution from eastern China and the industrial region surrounding Hanoi (Red River Delta)"
- **Method**: HYSPLIT back-trajectories with clustering

### 4. El Niño → Air Mass Trajectory Perturbation → Change in Pollution Sources
- **Mechanism**: El Niño perturbed air mass trajectories, bringing more western air masses, causing temporary decrease of sulfate AOD and increase of smoke AOD
- **Quote**: "the existence of El Niño perturbed the air masses trajectories during three winters (2014/15, 2015/16 and 2018/19), bringing more western air masses"
- **Conditions**: El Niño years

### 5. Pollution Source Shift (2006-2020)
- **2006/07 to 2010/11**: Biomass burning from Indochina Peninsula was dominant
- **2011/12 to 2019/20**: Coal-based industrial activities from eastern China and Northern Vietnam became dominant
- **Quote**: "From winter 2011/12 to winter 2019/20 however, the pollution plumes were mostly observed over eastern China and to a lesser extent, Northern Vietnam, and the sulfate partial AOD indicated they came from coal-based industrial activities"

## Spatial Scope
- Primary: Hanoi, Red River Delta, Northern Vietnam
- Secondary: Eastern China (source region), Indochina Peninsula

## Temporal Scope
- Study period: 2006-2020
- Focus: Winter period (October to March)
- 10-15 Northeast monsoons per winter

## Methods Used
- NAAPS model (AOD data)
- HYSPLIT back-trajectories
- In-situ PM2.5 observations
