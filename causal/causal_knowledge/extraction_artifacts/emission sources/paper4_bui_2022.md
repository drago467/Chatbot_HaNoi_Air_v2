## Key Findings

### PM2.5 Concentrations
- 47 ambient 24-h PM2.5 samples collected during summer and fall
- Average concentrations substantially higher than WHO guidelines
- Cd levels: 40.33x (summer) and 26.64x (fall) higher than WHO guidelines

### Chemical Composition
- Most abundant elements: Al, Fe, Pb, Zn
- Accounting for 85.14% (summer) and 89.06% (fall) of total elements

### Source Apportionment (PCA + EF analysis)
Major sources identified:
1. **Non-exhaust traffic emission and crustal dust**
2. **Exhaust traffic emission**
3. **Coal combustion**
4. **Industrial source**

### Key Quotes for Extraction

**Source Apportionment Results**:
> "The obtained results from principal component analysis (PCA) combined with enrichment factor (EF) analysis showed good agreement and suggested that the major sources of PM2.5 were non-exhaust traffic emission and crustal dust, exhaust traffic emission, coal combustion, and industrial source."

**Traffic Emissions**:
> "Non-exhaust traffic emission and crustal dust" - identified as major source
> "Exhaust traffic emission" - identified as separate major source

**Coal Combustion**:
> "Coal combustion" - identified as major PM2.5 source

**Industrial Source**:
> "Industrial source" - identified as major PM2.5 source

### Study Details
- **Location**: Inner-city sampling site in Hanoi
- **Period**: Summer and fall seasons
- **Sampling**: 47 samples, 24-hour collection
- **Method**: PCA combined with Enrichment Factor (EF) analysis

### Relevance
This paper confirms multiple emission sources contributing to PM2.5 in Hanoi:
- Traffic (both exhaust and non-exhaust)
- Coal combustion
- Industrial activities
- Crustal dust (resuspension)
